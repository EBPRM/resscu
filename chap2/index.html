<p><em>Demographic characteristics:</em> The annual incidence of spinal cord
injury varies between countries. In the USA for the past two decades it
has remained unchanged at 40 per million population per
year<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Elsewhere it usually does not exceed 20 new cases per
million population per year. <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>  In the UK the
incidence ranges from 10 to 15 per million population per year. In
recent years there has been an increase in the proportion of injuries to
the cervical spinal cord, with more tetraplegic patients than
paraplegics being admitted to hospital.</p>
<p><em>Race:</em> There has been a trend in the incidence in various ethnic groups
in the USA with an increase in Afro-Caribbean and a decrease in the
White population. Currently the incidence is 63% among Caucasian, 22.7%
Afro-Caribbean, 11.8% in the Hispanic population and fewer than 2% in
the Asian population.<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Sex:</em> Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) occurs predominantly among men, the
male-to-female ratio is approximately 4:1.</p>
<p><em>Age:</em> SCI incidence rates are lowest for the paediatric age group,
highest for persons in their late teens and early twenties, and declines
thereafter. The average age at injury is 39.5 years. About 3.5% occur in
children aged below 15 years of age. There has been an increasing
incidence of spinal cord injury in persons older than 60 years
(11.5%).<sup id="fnref2:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Prevalence:</em> Although the incidence reflects the number of new cases
that occur each year, prevalence is defined as the number of persons
with a SCI who are currently alive. In the UK it is estimated that there
are 40,000 persons with SCI. The prevalence of SCI in the USA is
estimated to be between 721 and 906 per million populations. The
Stockholm study reported a prevalence rate of 227 per million.</p>
<p><em>Causes of spinal cord injury:</em> Overall, motor vehicle crashes are the
leading cause of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI); the most common causes of SCI
remain motor vehicle accidents (42%), falls (27.1%), interpersonal
violence (15.3%) and sports (7.4%). Other non-traumatic causes of SCI
include vascular disorders, tumours, inflammation, infection,
demyelinating diseases, disc prolapse, iatrogenic injuries including
spinal injections and epidural catheter placement, vertebral fractures
secondary to osteoporosis, Vitamin B12 deficiency, congenital and
developmental disorders.</p>

<p>Traumatic spinal cord injuries are potentially catastrophic injuries.
Their medical and nonmedical effects can be devastating if not
adequately and simultaneously managed. SCI causes generalised
physiological impairment and multisystem malfunctions that depend on the
reflex activity of the spinal cord segments distal to the lesion.
Changes in the level of reflex activity of the spinal cord occur
throughout the patient’s life with often unpredictable changes in
function of the various body systems.</p>
<p>Each system malfunction is a source of multiple disabilities and a
potential source of a wide variety and range of complications. For
example impairment of bladder functions can result in urinary
incontinence, detrusor overactivity, urinary infections, hydronephrosis
and renal failure.</p>
<p>When a complication develops, the loss of the co-ordinating and
moderating functions of the brain usually results in a cascade of
intersystem effects that are rarely seen in other conditions. These are
rarely easy to manage. For example, an anal fissure, while painless in
these patients can nevertheless cause excess spasticity which in turn
may cause a fall and fracture of a long bone. Alternatively, excess
spasticity involving the pelvic floor muscles can result in urinary
retention, autonomic dysreflexia with devastating symptoms and signs,
and possibly cerebrovascular accident.</p>
<p>Conventional symptoms and signs of pathology are absent because of
sensory impairment or loss below the injury. This can result in delay of
diagnosis usually with unpleasant consequences.</p>
<p>Adding the number of disabilities and potential complications to the
various system impairments, one can easily appreciate the magnitude of
the burden to the patient, partner, carers, and the team responsible for
the treatment, rehabilitation and education of the patient. Almost all
complications following SCI are preventable and when developed their
effects can be minimised. The nonmedical effects of SCI are equally
devastating to patients and family members.</p>
<p>The importance of planning the management programme, including frequent
reassessments, re-calibration and modification of the programme,
according to the level of the reflex activity of the spinal cord and the
various levels of functionality of the various systems of the body
throughout the patient’s life cannot be overemphasised. The only
difference in the requirement for monitoring between the acute stage and
the long term is the frequency of the monitoring.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the incidence of spinal cord injuries is the lowest of all
major trauma injuries. A general hospital serving a population of
250,000 in the UK is likely to receive fewer than four newly injured
patients per year. The competencies of clinicians and allied
professionals required for adequate expert multidisciplinary management
of SCI patients cannot be developed to adequately manage such complex
conditions in general hospitals with such small numbers of patients. The
management of SCI patients is therefore safer, more efficient and more
cost-effective in Spinal Injuries Centres (SIC) equipped with the
infrastructure of equipment, knowledge, skills and expertise of
adequately trained multidisciplinary teams when compared to general
hospitals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SIC, where large numbers of patients are treated, are able
to provide supervised peer support, which is of incalculable value in
the facilitation of the management and psychological well-being of
patients with SCI.</p>
<h2 id="classification-terminology">Classification Terminology<a class="headerlink" href="#classification-terminology" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>SCI can be broadly classified as complete or incomplete. This is a
pathological definition. The diagnosis of complete SCI cannot be made
however until the stage of spinal cord shock resolves. It is therefore
prudent, until the reflexes return, to describe the clinical
presentation as complete sensory and motor loss or as incomplete loss of
either or both modalities.</p>
<p>Once the tendon reflexes return, if there is still no motor or sensory
function below the injury, by definition the injury is complete. If,
following the return of the reflexes, the patient has only some motor
power or sensation below the level of injury, the patient is considered
to be sensory incomplete. If the reflexes have returned and the patient
has both some motor function and sensation below the level of injury,
the patient is also considered to be incomplete.</p>
<h2 id="the-incomplete-sci-syndromes-are-classified-clinically-as-follows">The Incomplete SCI Syndromes are Classified Clinically as Follows<a class="headerlink" href="#the-incomplete-sci-syndromes-are-classified-clinically-as-follows" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><em>Central Cord Syndrome (CCS):</em> Central Cord Syndrome is caused by a
spinal cord lesion in the centre of the cord, usually involving a
cervical lesion, with greater motor weakness in the upper extremities
than in the lower extremities.</p>
<p>The falls and the motor vehicle collisions are the most common causes,
followed by cervical canal stenosis with extension injury,
intramedullary haematoma, mass or syrinx.</p>
<p>CCS is the most common of the SCI syndromes. It classically affects the
elderly, and C4 and C5 are the most common levels affected. Sensory loss
is variable and the patient is more likely to lose pain and/or
temperature sensation than joint position or vibration. Dysaesthesia
(sensation of burning in the hands or arms), especially in the upper
extremities is common. Sacral sensory sparing usually exists. Frankel D
is the most common impairment score. Diagnosis is supported by MRI
evidence of signal changes in the centre of the cervical cord.</p>
<p>The prognosis of CCS is considered favourable for functional recovery,
especially in those below the age of 50. The clinical outcomes are
significantly worse in patients aged 70 years or older.<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The lower extremities recover first and to a greater extent. Similarly
distal muscle recovery is greater in the upper limbs with intrinsic
muscle recovery in the hands occuring before recovery of shoulder
muscles.</p>
<p>Following the initial period of supervised bed rest, treatment involves
splinting of the hands in a functional position, strengthening and Range
of Motion (ROM) exercises, trunk balance, posture stabilisation, and ADL
and mobility training with appropriate assistive devices. Surgery may be
indicated if there are symptoms or signs of progressive neurological
deficits.</p>
<p><em>Brown-Sequard Syndrome (BSS):</em> Brown-Sequard Syndrome is an incomplete
lesion in the spinal cord involving a relatively greater loss of
proprioception and motor function on the same side of the spinal cord
damage, along with loss of pain and temperature sensation in the
opposite half of the cord damage. Horner’s syndrome may be present and
this is due to the involvement of the sympathetic tracts.</p>
<p>BSS is classically seen in stab injuries and bullet wounds involving
hemisection of the spinal cord, and it is also seen with most other
causes of the traumatic spinal cord injury. On examination there is
ipsilateral weakness and sensory loss for proprioception (vibration and
touch) with preservation of pain and temperature sensation.
Contralateral motor power and proprioception are preserved but pain and
temperature sensations are impaired. Most patients (up to 90%) will gain
mobility. Recovery is common in proximal extensors followed by the
distal flexors.  </p>
<p><em>Anterior Cord Syndrome (ACS):</em> Anterior Cord Syndrome involves
impairment of motor function and pain and/or temperature sensation, with
preservation of proprioception (touch, two point discrimination and
vibration sense). ACS is seen in lesions affecting the anterior two
thirds of the spinal cord sparing the posterior columns. ACS can occur
at any level of the spinal cord.</p>
<p>Common causes are vascular insufficiency or obstruction to the anterior
spinal artery, mechanical compression from stenosis and trauma. Risk
factors include aortic or spinal surgery, hyperflexion injury,
atherosclosis and thrombotic disorders. MRI, angiography and screening
for hypercoagulation status usually establishes the clinical diagnosis.</p>
<p>Treatment in addition to management of the causes is similar to other
incomplete syndromes. Functional electrical stimulation and Botulinum
toxin may be indicated in selected cases for functional restoration and
focal spasticity respectively.</p>
<p>Prognosis is generally considered poor and is determined by the extent
of the cord damage. About 10 to 20% however recover motor functions.</p>
<p><em>Conus Medullaris Syndrome (CMS):</em> Conus Medullaris Syndrome is a sacral
cord injury with or without involvement of the lumbar nerve roots. This
syndrome is characterised by areflexia in the bladder, bowel, and to a
lesser degree, lower limbs.</p>
<p>Motor and sensory loss in the lower limbs is variable, being typically
bilateral but may be asymmetric. It can manifest as sciatica, saddle
anaesthesia, or bowel and bladder areflexia.</p>
<p>Prognosis is generally considered poor. Individuals with complete
perineal anaesthesia are less likely to recover natural bladder
functions.</p>
<p><em>Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES):</em> Cauda Equina Syndrome involves injury to
the lumbosacral nerve roots within the neural canal and is characterised
by areflexic bowels and/or bladder, with variable motor and sensory loss
in the lower limbs.</p>
<p>This injury is usually caused by a central lumbar disc prolapse, or
following lumbar epidural injections. Because this syndrome is a nerve
root injury rather than a true spinal cord injury, the affected limbs
are areflexic. Clean intermittent self-catheterisation and manual bowel
evacuation regimes are likely to be required for the management of the
neuropathic bladder and bowels. Ankle foot orthosis are useful for ankle
weakness to aid ambulation.</p>
<h2 id="physical-examination">Physical Examination<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-examination" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The initial clinical evaluation begins with a primary survey. The
primary survey focuses on life-threatening conditions. Assessment of
airways, breathing, and circulation takes precedence. A spinal cord
injury must be considered concurrently following any major trauma.</p>
<p>The clinical assessment of pulmonary function in acute spinal cord
injury begins with a careful history regarding respiratory symptoms and
a review of underlying cardiopulmonary comorbidities such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure. Evaluation also includes
respiratory rate, chest wall expansion, abdominal wall movement, force
of cough, chest, limbs and other associated injuries according to a
detailed secondary survey.</p>
<p>Arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry are especially useful
because the bedside diagnosis of hypoxia or carbon dioxide
(CO<sub>2</sub>) retention may be difficult. The degree of respiratory
dysfunction depends on pre-existing pulmonary status, the level of SCI,
and any associated chest wall or lung injury. The pulmonary function may
be impaired in SCI as a result of loss of ventilatory muscle function
from denervation, lung injury, such as pneumothorax, haemothorax, or
pulmonary contusion, and decreased central ventilatory drive that is
associated with head injury or the effects of alcohol and drugs.</p>
<p>The axial skeleton should be examined to identify and provide initial
treatment of potentially unstable spinal fractures from both a
mechanical and a neurological basis.</p>
<p>The cervical spine and paraspinal tissues should be evaluated for pain,
swelling, bruising, or malalignment during palpation. Logrolling the
patient to systematically examine each spinous process of the entire
axial skeleton from the occiput to the sacrum can help identify and
localise injury.</p>
<p>In all patients, a careful, complete and detailed neurological
assessment, including motor function, sensory evaluation, deep tendon
reflexes, and perineal evaluation including the deep anal sensation with
per rectal examination, is critical to establish the presence or absence
of SCI, the level of injury, the density of the cord damage and to
classify the lesion according to a specific cord syndrome. Complete
bilateral loss of sensation or motor function below a certain level
indicates a complete SCI. The presence or absence of sacral sparing can
be a key prognostic indicator.</p>
<h2 id="neurological-classification">Neurological Classification<a class="headerlink" href="#neurological-classification" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Clinicians have used the Frankel classification to grade the severity of
neurological loss.<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> Frankel in 1969 classified the density
of the neurological lesion into five categories<sup id="fnref2:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> according
to the presence or absence of normal neurology, and if the neurology is
abnormal according to the presence or absence of motor power or
sensation below the level of injury.</p>
<h3 id="the-frankel-grading-system12">The Frankel Grading System<sup id="fnref3:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup><a class="headerlink" href="#the-frankel-grading-system12" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><em>1. ‘Complete’ (Frankel - A):</em> This means that the lesion is found to be
complete, both motor and sensory, below the segmental level marked. If
there is an alteration of level but the lesion remains complete below
the new level, then the arrow points up or down the ‘complete’ column.</p>
<p><em>2. ‘Sensory only’ (Frankel – B):</em> This implies that there is some
sensation present below the level of lesion but that the motor paralysis
is complete below that level. This column does not apply when there is a
slight discrepancy between the motor and sensory level but does apply to
sacral sparing.</p>
<p><em>3. ‘Motor Useless’ (Frankel - C):</em> This implies that there is some
motor power present below the lesion but it is of no practical use to
the patient.</p>
<p><em>4. ‘Motor Useful’ (Frankel - D):</em> This implies that there is useful
motor power below the level of the lesion. Patients in this group can
move the lower limbs and many can walk, with or without aids.</p>
<p><em>5. ‘Recovery’ (Frankel - E):</em> This implies that the patient is free of
neurological symptoms, i.e. no weakness, no sensory loss, no sphincter
disturbance. Abnormal reflexes may be present.</p>
<p>The Frankel classification system is still the most widely used
classification by the clinicians from all the disciplines. The advantage
of the Frankel classification is that with a single letter of the
alphabet, it can describe both the density of neurological damage at a
particular level, the presence or absence of sparing, and the type of
sparing (motor and/or sensory) below the level of the injury. Any
significant effect of treatment resulting in change of neurology can be
easily described by repeating the neurological assessment, and
documented by using a letter of the alphabet from A to E. The Frankel
classification is not however sensitive enough to elicit small changes
in the neurology to move from one grade to the other, but it remains the
most practical method for describing the progress of a patient or group
of patients in the clinical situation.</p>
<h3 id="asia-classification">ASIA Classification<a class="headerlink" href="#asia-classification" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In 1982, based on the Frankel classification, the American Spinal Injury
Association (ASIA) first published standards for neurological
classification of patients with spinal cord injury.<sup id="fnref:13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup> In
1992, The International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS, formerly IMSoP)
adopted these guidelines to create true international standards. Further
refinements have been adopted including assessment of autonomic
functions. The American Spinal Injury Association has established
pertinent definitions. The neurological level of injury is the lowest
(most caudal) level with normal sensory and motor function. For example,
a patient with C6 quadriplegia has, by definition, abnormal motor and
sensory function in C7 and possibly C8 &amp; T1.</p>
<p>The ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) follows the Frankel scale but differs in
several important respects. First, instead of no function below the
injury level, AIS - A is defined as a person with no motor or sensory
function preserved in the sacral segments S4-S5. This definition is
clear and unambiguous. There could be sensory and motor functions in
both the myotomes and the dermatomes of long tracts between the cervical
spinal cord and S3, but the pathology would still be described as a
complete AIS - A cervical lesion. Such a patient in other words would be
described as incomplete Frankel B but according to the ASIA
classification he/she would be described as complete AIS-A.</p>
<p>AIS-B is essentially identical to Frankel B but adds the requirement of
preserved sacral S4-S5 function. It should be noted that AIS - A and B
classification depend entirely on a single observation, i.e. the
preservation of motor and sensory function of S4-5. In other words, a
sensory incomplete Frankel B patient will not be considered as having
long tract sparing below a C5 lesion if he/she did have sensory sparing
to S2 or S3 but not S4-S5.</p>
<p>ASIA stipulated that a patient would be an AIS-C if more than half of
the muscles evaluated had a grade of less than 3/5. If more than half of
the muscles evaluated had a grade of more than 3, the person was
assigned to AIS-D.</p>
<p>AIS-E is spinal column injury without any detectable neurological
deficit on a neurological examination.</p>
<p>The ASIA classified incomplete spinal cord injuries into five types,
Central Cord Syndrome, Brown-Sequard Syndrome, Anterior Cord Syndrome,
Conus Medullaris and Cauda Equina Syndrome.</p>
<p><em>The American Spinal Injury Association recommends the use of the
following (from MRC - Medical Research Council) scale for the assessment
of motor strength:</em></p>
<p>0 - No contraction or movement</p>
<p>1 - Minimal movement</p>
<p>2 - Active movement, but not against gravity</p>
<p>3 - Active movement against gravity</p>
<p>4 - Active movement against resistance</p>
<p>5 - Active movement against full resistance</p>
<p><em>The key muscles that need to be tested to establish the neurological
level are as follows:</em></p>

<p>It must be appreciated that neither the Frankel nor the ASIA
classification specifies the response of sensory appreciation to testing
with a pin. We believe it is relevant to differentiate between the
patient feeling the pin as “pin prick” and feeling the pin as “deep
touch” considering that these are likely to have different prognostic
values. 16, 17, 18</p>
<h2 id="management-of-spinal-injuries">Management of Spinal Injuries<a class="headerlink" href="#management-of-spinal-injuries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The primary objectives in the management of SCI patients include
minimising the neurological damage caused during the primary injury and
also preventing further injury to the damaged cord secondary to
hypoperfusion, ischaemia, biochemical and inflammatory changes.</p>
<p>Active Physiological Conservative Management (APCM) <sup id="fnref2:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> is
based on these objectives; it is the active simultaneous, nonsurgical
management, from the early hours of injury, of the injured spine, of the
multisystem neurogenic effects of spinal cord injury on respiratory,
cardiovascular, urinary, gastrointestinal, dermatological, sexual, and
reproductive functions, and of the associated psychological effects,
rehabilitation and environmental modifications.</p>
<p>During APCM, containment of the biomechanical instability is safely
maintained in recumbency for 4-6 weeks followed by bracing during
mobilisation for a further six weeks.</p>
<p>All patients with SCI are removed from the long spinal board within
twenty minutes of arrival at the emergency department or as soon as
possible. Patients are moved and handled in such as a way as to prevent
secondary spinal cord lesions due to inappropriate mechanical forces and
to prevent pressure area damage. All patients with a spinal cord injury
and/or complex and multiple spinal column injuries are managed on a
spinal bed within 24hrs. Spinal column alignment is maintained
throughout all turns, procedures and transfer manoeuvres. All patients
are closely monitored for neurological change and pressure area
protection. All patients will have a regime of 2-3 hourly spinal logroll
turns established as soon as is practical following admission. Patients
are left in the turned position on their side for a maximum of 3 hours,
or as long as the patient tolerates it, whichever is shorter. Unless
contraindicated by other injuries, within the first 24hrs post injury,
nursing staff can provide a twice daily range of passive exercises for
the hands and feet, supported by regular repositioning to prevent
equinus and upper limb and finger contractures. This should commence
with placing the feet in a 90˚ resting position, using pillows and
avoiding force. The hands are positioned on small pillows. For the
tetraplegic patients, shoulders are kept in the abducted position and
alternate arms are raised at each turn.</p>
<p>All spinal cord injured patients are kept nil by mouth for at least
48hrs, and commenced on Proton Pump Inhibitors as soon as possible for
prevention of gastrointestinal stress ulcers. A light diet, or enteral
or parenteral feeding, is introduced gradually when bowel sounds return
to normal. Patients are referred to a dietician for assessment and
nutritional support within 72hrs. Bowel regime is instigated on
admission and this is modified according to individual response.</p>
<p>As all acute SCI patients present with definitive neurological bladder
dysfunction, the paralysed bladder is at significant risk of nosocomial
infection. It is therefore of paramount importance to prevent bladder
distension and catheter blockage. All patients are catheterised on
admission with a size 12 – 16 gauge catheter. Indwelling catheters
should be maintained on free drainage and changed at least weekly. Once
the patient is stable and fluid balance is within acceptable limits the
indwelling catheter should be removed and patients are commenced on a 4
hourly intermittent catheterisation.</p>
<p>To prevent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, anticoagulation
therapy is appropriately established within 48hrs. All SCI patients are
fitted with properly sized thigh length TED stockings. Foot pumps or
compression boots can be used, but it is important to monitor the
pressure effect on the neuropathic skin in an SCI individual.</p>
<p>Physiotherapists are involved at the earliest opportunity with a view to
providing an assessment of limb movements.</p>
<p>SCI patients can present with spinal shock which can compromise their
cardiovascular status and stability. The underlying pathogenesis is the
loss of the baroreceptor reflex and basal sympathetic tone in high
spinal cord lesions. Also the treating team should be aware of the fact
that logrolling and repositioning may cause stimulation of the vagus
nerve. Atropine, usually 0.3 - 0.6 mgs, may be required to treat syncope
attacks associated with bradycardia when the heart rate is below 35.
Intravenous fluids are administered judiciously to prevent fluid
overload. The patient’s core temperature is closely monitored as SCI
patients may not be able to internally regulate their body temperature,
depending on the level and extent of injury.</p>
<p>In cervical injuries the neck is secured with a rigid cervical collar
and sandbags are placed on each side of the head. It is important to
note that cervical collars alone are ineffective in minimising motion,
both flexion and extension, of the injured cervical spine. The most
commonly used collars are the Philadelphia or Miami J collars, but these
are not appropriate for long-term stabilisation. Cervical collars allow
30 to 65% of normal motion. Cervical spine immobilisation is best
achieved with a Halo device; this only permits less than 5% of normal
cervical spine motion. Many cervical spine injuries can be treated
without surgery. Immobilisation in a rigid cervical orthosis for 8 to 12
weeks is usually sufficient. For a stable cervical spine injury without
compression of the neural elements, a rigid cervical brace or Halo vest
system for 8 to 12 weeks usually produces a stable, painless spine
without any residual deformity. Facet dislocations following reduction
in traction may be immobilised in a halo vest for 8 to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>Before mobilisation, all spinal injuries, with or without neurological
deficits, should be evaluated clinically for localised tenderness and
radiologic with dynamic radiographs in the flexion and extension
positions.</p>
<p>The ultimate goals of APCM management are to ensure maximum neurological
recovery and independence, a pain-free flexible spine, safe functioning
of the various systems of the body with minimal or no inconvenience to
patients, and prevention or minimisation of complications. The great
majority of injuries become biomechanically stable and pain free.</p>
<p>Unfortunately surgery has become the preferred method of management,
also known as the “Standard of Care”, of traumatic spinal injuries.
Currently, about 80% of patients with TSCI are surgically decompressed
and stabilised without the rigours of adequate research methodology or
demonstration of superiority of neurological and/or other outcomes over
APCM. Currently, resources are relatively easily found for surgical
implants and surgical procedures in both the developing and developed
world. However, it is increasingly difficult to find resources for the
management of the effects of the SCI and the rehabilitation of the
patient in both the acute stage and in the long term.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that surgical stabilisation enhances the
speed of healing or achieves stability earlier than with APCM.
Admittedly the incidence of kyphotic deformities is lower following
surgical stabilisation than following APCM, however the large majority
of these kyphotic deformities are painless. The discrepancy between
deformity and pain has been known for some time. Painless kyphotic
deformity enhances the independence of wheelchair-bound patients and is
certainly preferable to a stiff, straight neck or back following
surgery.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that surgical decompression achieves
better or earlier neurological recovery than APCM in humans with
incomplete cord or cauda equina injury.</p>
<p>Patients with paralysis, general physiological impairment and
multisystem malfunction do not benefit from early mobilisation, which
indeed may be counterproductive. Early mobilisation of patients is
associated with a reduction of vital capacity and a potential drop of
oxygen saturation and /or postural hypotension. Individually, or in
combination, these may further impair cord functions. Early mobilisation
does not result in early completion of rehabilitation nor earlier
discharge of patients with SCI.</p>
<p>Until credible evidence demonstrates superiority of outcome with one
method of treatment of the injured spine over the other, patients should
be encouraged to make an informed choice between the various methods of
management, assuming that the patient will receive treatment in an
institution that can provide equally good APCM and surgical management.</p>
<p>Certain groups of patients are likely to benefit from surgery and should
be encouraged to consider the option. Neurologically intact patients
with a physiologically stable cord but unstable injured spine, the
uncontrolled epileptic, the mentally-challenged, and patients who are
unable to comply with bed rest, are safer following surgical
stabilisation than with conservative management. Patients with
biomechanical instability from pure ligamentous injuries without bony
injury are at risk of developing late painful deformities and indeed may
benefit from early surgery. Patients who exhibit signs of neurological
deterioration with evidence of further neurological compression of
neural tissues on MRI may benefit from surgical decompression.</p>
<h2 id="prognostic-determinants-of-recovery">Prognostic Determinants of Recovery<a class="headerlink" href="#prognostic-determinants-of-recovery" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The prognostic determinants of neurological recovery have been
extensively studied over the last five decades.</p>
<p>Frankel et al in 1969 studied 682 consecutive patients admitted within
14 days of injury.<sup id="fnref4:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> He divided these patients into 5 groups
from Frankel A to E according to the neurological
presentation<sup id="fnref5:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup>. He demonstrated that with Active
Physiological Conservative Management (APCM)<sup id="fnref3:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> about 60% of
the FB patients (i.e. presenting with complete motor paralysis of lower
limbs (LL) but sensory sparing) recovered significant power in the LL to
resume ambulation. Patients presenting with minimal and useless LL motor
sparing (FC) did better, with 78.43% recovering ambulation. These
results were subsequently confirmed.<sup id="fnref:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup> </p>
<p>Since the mid-eighties El Masri(y) and colleagues have been studying
qualitatively and quantitatively the prognostic value of the different
sensory modalities and motor sparing in various groups of patients
admitted within 72 hours from injury and treated with
APCM.<sup id="fnref4:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup>  They found that 86% of FC patients recovered
significant motor power to resume ambulation. Of those presenting in the
FB group with spared spinothalamic Pin Prick (PP) sensation, 71%
recovered useful motor power to ambulate. However, only 33% of patients
with post column sparing recovered7. El Masri(y) and
colleagues also studied the prognostic value of PP appreciation in FB
patients, finding that 75% of patients who felt the pin as PP and only
20% of those who felt the “pin as pressure” recovered ambulation. The
percentage of motor points recovery in FB patients with PP sparing was
80.2% and a similar 79.6% in FC patients.<sup id="fnref:18"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> Rectal sensation
on rectal examination was a poor predictor of recovery and only 12.5% of
patients recovered ambulation16. The outcomes of these
prognostic indicators were not affected by mal-alignment, spinal canal
stenosis, degree of canal encroachment, degree of cord compression, or
spinal column instability.<sup id="fnref5:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2:18"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:19"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:20"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:20">20</a></sup>  None of the

containment of both the “biomechanical instability” of the spinal column
and the “physiological instability” of the spinal cord.<sup id="fnref:22"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:22">22</a></sup> The
injured spine and the medical and nonmedical effects of the SCI were
managed with the patient in recumbency for about 6 weeks. This
facilitated the prevention of complications such as hypoxia, hypotension
which can cause reduction of spinal cord perfusion, hypertension which
can cause increased cord haemorrhage, hypothermia, generalised sepsis,
and/or severe anaemia.</p>
<p>To date there is no evidence that neurological recovery following
traumatic SCI is limited in patients over 65 years of age compared with
younger patients. Their pre-existing health and mobility may however
influence both capability and quality of ambulation. Patients younger
than 65 years with muscle grade of 3 or greater in the myotome L3 and
S1, and light touch sensation in the dermatome L3 and S1 within 15 days
of injury (all within ASIA impairment scale D), are more likely to be
independent indoor walkers within a year of injury.<sup id="fnref:23"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:23">23</a></sup> Further
studies are required to assess the power of the various prognostic
indicators at different times from injury and their applicability to
test outcomes of interventions not only for ambulation and functional
recovery but also for autonomic functions such as bladder, bowel,
cardiorespiratory, vasomotor, erectile and reproductive
functions.<sup id="fnref:24"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:24">24</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="deep-venous-thrombosis"><strong><em>Deep Venous Thrombosis:</em></strong><a class="headerlink" href="#deep-venous-thrombosis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE), are common
complications of SCI, and continue to be a major cause of morbidity and
mortality. Despite preventative measures the incidence of clinical DVT
is reported in 9.8 % and PE in 2.6 % of patients during the phase of
acute rehabilitation following SCI.<sup id="fnref:25"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the risk of pulmonary emboli is highest between the
2nd and 4th week of injury, the risk of DVT drops
approximately 20 days after the initial SCI<sup id="fnref:26"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:26">26</a></sup>. Although the
incidence of clinically significant thromboembolism appears to be
relatively small, effective prophylactic measures need to be utilised,
given the potentially devastating consequences.</p>
<p><em>Pathophysiology and Risk Factors:</em> The blood vessel wall may be injured
by extrinsic pressure on the paralysed extremity in the neurologically
impaired patient. Altered blood flow results in venous stasis that
predisposes the individual to the development of a thrombus. Alterations
in blood constituents also result in alterations in haemostasis and a
hypercoagulable state seen in patients with SCI. A higher incidence of
DVT is seen with motor complete injuries, paraplegics and in males.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Presentation and Investigations:</em> Limb swelling, warmth and
discolouration are usually associated with DVT. Pain in the calf is
unlikely to be a feature. In a patient with a clinical suspicion for
DVT, initial evaluation is carried out with venous ultrasound if the
results are equivocal or negative. If clinical suspicion is high,
venography should be performed.</p>
<p>Presenting symptoms in PE are dyspnoea, tachypnoea, tachycardia, fever,
or chest pain; these are also symptoms found with pneumonia or
atelectasis. Less commonly, PE may present as syncope, hypotension and
cardiac arrhythmia. It is important to have a high index of suspicion
for DVT and PE because of the potentially fatal consequences.</p>
<p><em>Treatment and Management of Thromboembolism:</em> The standard treatment
for established venous thromboembolism has been anticoagulation with
unfractionated heparin, given by constant intravenous infusion, followed
immediately by oral warfarin for a specified number of months. Standard
anticoagulation will not prevent embolization of an existing thrombus or
induce dissolution of the thrombus.</p>
<p>Recently, an increasing number of Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH)
have become available and have been studied as an initial treatment for
acute thromboembolism. After initiation of treatment with LMWH, oral
anticoagulation with warfarin follows and should be continued long term.</p>
<p>The purpose of long term anticoagulant therapy is to prevent recurrent
DVT. Warfarin is administered at an initial dosage of 5 to 10 mg/day for
the first 2 days. The daily dose is then adjusted according to the
International Normalised Ratio (INR). The INR has become the accepted
standardisation of the Prothrombin Time (PT) for monitoring oral
anticoagulant therapy. Heparin therapy is discontinued on the fourth or
fifth day following initiation of warfarin therapy, provided the INR is
in the recommended therapeutic range of 2 to 3. Frequent INR
determinations are often required early on to establish the therapeutic
dose of warfarin. The optimal duration of treatment should be at least 6
months.</p>
<p><em>Prevention of Thromboembolism:</em> Considering the significant risk,
morbidity, and mortality of thromboembolism in the SCI population, it is
clear that methods to prevent the development of this medical
complication should be strongly considered and implemented.</p>
<p><em>Non-pharmacological Modalities:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive Range of Motion (ROM) exercises should be initiated by
    &gt; physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and nurses at the acute
    &gt; stage of SCI</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Graduated elastic or compression stockings</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Pneumatic compression sleeves</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Placement of vena cava filters is frequently performed in certain
    &gt; high-risk patient populations to prevent the development of PE;
    &gt; however, one should remember that the presence of a filter itself
    &gt; does not prevent the development of venous thrombosis.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Warfarin:</em> As a means of prophylaxis, the use of warfarin has the
advantage of being orally effective. However, it has the disadvantage of
requiring close monitoring of INR, and the increased risk of bleeding
and its associated complications.</p>
<p><em>Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH):</em> The benefits and increased
effectiveness of LMWH for the prevention of thromboembolism in a variety
of patient populations has been increasingly studied in recent years and
it has been suggested and recommended as one of the more effective forms
of DVT prophylaxis in patients with acute SCI.</p>
<p><em>Duration of preventive management:</em> Although generally the recommended
treatment is for 6 months, the duration of prophylaxis should be
individualised, depending on the risk factors, medical condition,
functional status, and care and support services of the SCI
individual.<sup id="fnref3:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="endocrine-function">Endocrine Function<a class="headerlink" href="#endocrine-function" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The endocrine system is affected in SCI patients, primarily due to
unpredictable, sympathetic nervous system dysfunction and the effects of
inactivity. SCI has an impact on the endocrine system in several ways.
The diagnosis and treatment of common endocrine disorders presents
unique challenges in this patient population.</p>
<p><strong>The Spectrum of Endocrine Abnormalities after SCI</strong></p>
<p>SCI patients are predisposed to chest and other infections, resulting in
increased antidiuretic hormone levels and hyponatremia.</p>
<p>The physical inactivity associated with SCI has a profound effect on
metabolic function. Decreased energy expenditure causes an increase in
adiposity. Muscle atrophy occurs below the level of the cord lesion.
Insulin resistance which occurs can result in diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipidaemia and hypertension.</p>
<p>As a chronic disease process, longstanding SCI can produce a variety of
nonspecific effects on endocrine function. Chronic pyelonephritis may
cause renal failure which results in phosphate retention, hypocalcaemia,
and secondary hyperparathyroidism.</p>
<p><em>Pituitary disorders</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Impaired growth hormone secretion, due to stress, such as that
    &gt; caused by injury or illness, results in reduced growth and muscle
    &gt; mass</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppressed gonadotropins result in low testosterone and oestrogen
    &gt; levels</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic
    &gt; hormone)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Central diabetes insipidus</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Associated head trauma presents with polyuria, low specific
    &gt; gravity urine and hypothyroidism from pituitary gland injury</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Adrenocortical hormones</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Without cortisol, SCI patients with infection and myocardial
    &gt; infarction are susceptible to irreversible shock.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Following SCI, levels of renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone
    &gt; hormones may be elevated.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Secondary adrenal hormonal insufficiency is seen with associated
    &gt; head trauma.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reproductive Function:</em> Semen analysis in SCI patients shows a
decreased number and motility of sperm and abnormal morphology. Female
sexual function is less affected.</p>
<p><em>Lipid disorders:</em> Multiple forms of lipid disorders may be seen in SCI
individuals as they are closely associated with diabetes mellitus.
Hypertriglyceridaemia, low HDL, and atherosclerosis are commonly seen
sequelae.</p>
<p><em>Glucose Metabolism in SCI:</em> Glucose intolerance is more common in SCI
individuals when compared with the general population. The level and
completeness of SCI correlates with the degree of impairment of glucose
intolerance. The higher the level and the more complete the SCI the
greater the glucose intolerance. Myocardial ischemia may be silent
because of the destruction of the sensory pathways hence the treating
team during the rehabilitation stage should be cautious and aware of
this.</p>
<p>In the acute stage following SCI, strict control of glucose is
recommended and insulin may be required. Weight loss and increased
physical activity are suggested. Reviews by an ophthalmologist,
podiatrist and endocrinologist are also required.</p>
<p>SCI patients can be at risk of both fasting and postprandial forms of
hypoglycaemia. Fasting hypoglycaemia is caused by a lack of glucose
production during gluconeogenesis, and can be seen in the increased
uptake of glucose into insulin-sensitive tissues.</p>
<p>In a tetraplegic person the usual signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia do
not occur. There is an atypical presentation with symptoms of impaired
glucose delivery to the brain, such as drowsiness and impaired
mentation.</p>
<p>Mild hypoglycaemia can be treated with oral glucose solutions or juice.
In more severe hypoglycaemia or in situations where oral administration
of glucose is not possible, parenteral therapy should be given.
Tetraplegic patients require assistance in the treatment of
hypoglycaemia.</p>
<p><em>Calcium Disorders</em> SCI patients are at increased risk of renal failure
and nephrotic syndrome. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by renal
failure, low calcium intake, or reduced exposure to sunlight as seen in
some SCI individuals. Impaired renal function results in phosphate
retention; this decreases the production of the active form of vitamin D
by the kidneys.</p>
<p>Secondary hyperparathyroidism results in the worsening of osteoporosis,
which further decreases the bone density of SCI patients. This increases
the risk of fracture. Patients with low serum albumin, as seen in some
SCI individuals, are further predisposed to decreased serum calcium.</p>
<p>Hypocalcaemia presents with physical findings of muscular irritability
such as tetany, but these can be difficult to elicit in SCI patients.
Hypocalcaemia is usually treated with the infusion of intravenous
calcium.</p>
<p>Hypercalcaemia is associated with immobilisation and other causes.
Clinical features include nausea and vomiting, mental confusion,
frequent urination, thirst and pyrexia. The treatment is hydration with
normal saline to encourage calcium excretion by kidneys. Pamidronate
(biphosphonate) may be used in adults for the treatment of
hypercalcaemia associated with immobilisation.</p>
<h3 id="fractures-of-long-bones">Fractures of Long Bones<a class="headerlink" href="#fractures-of-long-bones" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The potential for increased numbers of pathological fractures in SCI
patients exists because of increased life span and activity.</p>
<p><em>Fracture management in SCI patients can be divided into:</em></p>
<p>• Group 1: Fracture sustained in the same accident as the spinal cord
injury</p>
<p>• Group 2: Fracture occurred in osteoporotic bone of patients with
chronic SCI</p>
<p>• Group 3: Fracture in a chronic SCI caused by high energy</p>
<p><em>The treatment recommendations are:</em></p>
<p>• Group 1—Treat long bone fractures with either the conservative method
with closed manipulative reductions and immobilisation, or with open
reduction and internal fixation depending on the fracture personality</p>
<p>• Group 2—Minimal specific treatment needed. Open reduction and internal
fixation is usually contraindicated in a vast majority of the cases due
to increased postoperative implant-associated complications</p>
<p>• Group 3—Treatment by methods that are least likely to disrupt the
patient’s ADL.</p>
<p><em>Fractures in acute SCI:</em> Concomitant long bone fractures are not
uncommon with SCI. The fracture occurrence varies by gender, race,
injury level, and aetiology of injury. The knowledge of these associated
factors will aid in early recognition of fractures, preventing
complications, and facilitating rapid mobilisation and rehabilitation
outcomes of patients with SCI.</p>
<p>Silver and colleagues found that 27 out of 100 acute SCI patients had
concurrent fractures, with most of them involving ribs, sternum, and
clavicle.<sup id="fnref:27"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>In a series of 508 individuals with spine trauma (with or without neural
deficit), Saboe et al described associated injuries by anatomic site and
its content, including, but not limited to, fractures. Of these
patients, 240 were reported to have associated injuries, most commonly
involving head (26%), chest (24%), and long bone (23%).<sup id="fnref:28"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Wang and colleagues reported an incidence of 28% of patients with SCI
having associated extra spinal fractures. Of these patients 37% had more
than one fracture site.<sup id="fnref:29"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:29">29</a></sup> The most common region of fractures
was chest, followed by lower extremity, upper extremity, head and
others. The overall incidence rate was higher for women than men, for
whites than non-whites, for paraplegics than tetraplegics, and for those
injured in motor vehicle crashes than others. Compared with patients
having a single fracture, those who had multiple fractures were likely
to be white, paraplegic, and injured in motor vehicle crashes. There was
no age difference in the incidence of concurrent fractures, single or
multiple.</p>
<p>Fracture treatment should aim towards a union, maintenance of length,
prevention of angular deformity, and maximisation of functional return.</p>
<p>Because high-energy accidents often cause multiple injuries, emergency
stabilisation of organ systems is vital prior to treatment of the
extremity fractures. Femur fractures are the most common long bone
injury, followed by tibia, humerus, radius, and ulna fractures. Lower
extremity fractures have improved outcome with operative stabilisation
irrespective of the neurological status. Early operative treatment is
preferred for these fractures unless closed treatment can be carried out
with a functional orthosis, allowing adequate healing without delaying
participation of the patient in the process of rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Non-operative treatment is considered for complete injuries with
non-functional extremities. Inadequate non-operative treatment can delay
healing and lead to shortening and angular deformities.</p>
<p>Upper extremity fracture management is based on general orthopaedic
principles, with a tendency towards open reduction and internal
fixation. It must be appreciated that the upper limbs of a SCI patient
will have dual functionality substituting some of the lower limb
functions requiring sound healing of these fractures.</p>
<p><em>Complications:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pressure sores from splints, casts and external fixation devices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Splinting in the wrong position may lead to fixed deformity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delayed union, mal-union and non-union</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ankle fractures usually exhibit low-energy fracture patterns. They can
be treated with a padded posterior splint. Healing may occur by either
bony or fibrous union without complications. Angular deformities are
unacceptable because pressure sores can develop, commonly overlying
malleoli. Metatarsal base and toe fractures in the foot are usually
undisplaced and unite without serious complications using a soft splint.</p>
<h3 id="heterotopic-ossification">Heterotopic Ossification<a class="headerlink" href="#heterotopic-ossification" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Heterotopic Ossification (HO) is a pathological condition with true soft
tissue bone formation at the ectopic sites around the bone and joints
that is morphologically similar to normal skeletal bone. Reported
incidence varies greatly in the SCI population, ranging from
10–53%30.</p>
<p>The hip is the most common site (70–97%) for HO in SCI patients followed
by knee, shoulder and elbow. HO usually develops at 1 to 4 months
following acute SCI. In patients with SCI with clinically significant
HO, 20–30% present with a reduction in joint range of motion whereas 3 –
8% can develop complete ankylosis with loss of movement30.
Maturation of HO usually takes from 1 to 2 years. The risk factors
include complete SCI, spasticity, pressure ulcer and trauma. Forcible
stretching of the range of movement (ROM) can cause haemorrhage and new
HO.</p>
<p>Generally, HO is self-limiting and rarely requires surgery. Neurogenic
HO is also seen following associated traumatic brain injuries. The
severity of the injury on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) usually
correlates with the extent of the ossification measured in square
centimetres.<sup id="fnref:31"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>The clinical features are localised soft tissue swelling and decreased
ROM. HO can also present as low grade fever, joint effusion, pain with
ROM of the affected joint and limb swelling. In the acute phase the
presentation of HO around the hip can mimic an abscess.</p>
<p>An early diagnosis at a time of clinical uncertainty, before the plain
radiographic features develop, has distinct advantages and therapeutic
implications. The unique pathological evolution and maturation of the
lesion is clearly demonstrated by sequential ultrasound scan assessments
with depiction of the 'zone phenomena' seen on histological examination.
Sonographic scans of spinal injury patients proved diagnostic, before
radiographic evidence of heterotopic bone formation on plain X-rays, and
confidently excluded HO in patients without any false negative
results.<sup id="fnref:32"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Radiological diagnosis can be confirmed in the acute stages with triple
phase bone scan, and is considered as the gold standard investigation in
these stages. Plain x-rays will only show when there is established
calcification. Bone scans will become negative after both 6 months of
onset and when the HO is mature. Serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated
from 2 weeks with a peak at up to 10 weeks. After this period it will
become normal.</p>
<p>Medical treatment with etidronate sodium (bisphosphonate) or
indomethacin are typically effective before the formation of the mature
HO. Low dose radiation therapy can be useful in controlling HO and
preventing recurrence following surgical removal. Excessive force and
trauma to maintain ROM of the affected joint should be avoided in the
acute phase. Gentle passive ROM is important in maintaining joint
function. Once HO is identified, the ROM exercises should be withheld
until the inflammatory signs have subsided. Active-assistive range of
motion exercises should then be prescribed, and gentle passive range of
motion exercises should be initiated for completely paralysed joints.</p>
<p>Surgical resection of the established mature HO from bone scan and
normal alkaline phosphatase is only indicated to promote easier
positioning, transfers, wheelchair seating and ADL. The surgery can be
associated with infection, neurovascular injury, incomplete removal and
recurrence. There is a high risk of local recurrence of HO following
surgical excision.</p>
<h3 id="pressure-ulcers-and-wound-care">Pressure Ulcers and Wound Care<a class="headerlink" href="#pressure-ulcers-and-wound-care" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Despite current interest and advances in medicine, surgery, nursing
care, and self-care education, pressure ulcers, a well-known preventable
condition, still remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This
is more the case for patients with impaired sensation, prolonged
immobility, or advanced age. The incidence of pressure ulcers in
patients with spinal cord injury is reported in the range of 25-66
%.33, 34</p>
<p>The European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) and American National
Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) provide the following pressure
ulcer definition: “A pressure ulcer is localised injury to the skin
and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result of
pressure, or pressure in combination with shear”.</p>
<p>The pressure ulcers develop from progressive tissue ischemia as well as
from the reperfusion injury. The elevated tissue pressure prevents
capillary reperfusion leading to tissue death and necrosis. The severity
depends primarily on the degree and duration of the pressure exerted and
the location.</p>
<p>The common sites of involvement include the skin over the ischeal
tuberosities (28%), the sacrum (17-27%), the trochanter (12-19%), and
the heel (9-18%). Pressure ulcers commonly develop on the occiput and
the scapula of patients who were made to spend extended amounts of time
lying supine. The scapular regions are particularly vulnerable in
patients with cervical or upper thoracic cord lesions and sensory
impairment, being treated in a halo vest or body jacket. Patients with
the secondary manifestations of osteoporosis and associated thoracic
kyphosis can develop pressure ulcers over the spinous processes. Elderly
patients and patients with diabetes mellitus are more often prone to
develop pressure ulcers in the heels. The life time risk of pressure
ulcer in an SCI person is reported to be up to 80 %. High level lesions
and darker skin are associated with increased incidence.</p>
<p>Regular and frequent whole body assessment for skin integrity with
emphasis on “at risk areas” is an important aspect of pressure ulcer
care. The emphasis in the acute stage should be on a strict and regular
“manual” turning and positioning regime to prevent pressure on the
skin over any bony prominence for more than 3-4 hours if the patient is
on a pressure relieving mattress. More frequent turning (every 1-2
hours) is required if the patient is on an ordinary mattress. On a
relatively hard surface pressure sores can develop within less than an
hour, and much less than an hour in the stage of spinal shock.</p>
<p>The risk factors are impaired sensation, impaired mobility,
hypo-nutrition, vascular disease, diabetes, altered mental status,
incontinence, poor hygiene, shear and friction forces, old age, repeated
hospitalisation and institutionalisation without recognised and adequate
pressure-relief measures. Pressure sores are completely preventable
complications that attract successful litigation once developed.</p>
<p><em>International Pressure Ulcer Classification:</em> EPUAP and NPUAP have
agreed upon four levels of injury<sup id="fnref:35"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:35">35</a></sup>, recognising that the
terms unclassified / unstageable and deep tissue injury are generally
graded as “IV” in Europe.</p>
<p>Standardised measures of ulcer location, diameter, depth, stage, colour,
and drainage are necessary to provide qualitative and quantitative
information about the wound. This information is also essential to
monitor healing, to plan efficient wound treatment, and to document
progress. Photographs, which include a measuring tape close to the
ulcer, and diagrams, are currently useful additional tools for
monitoring the rate of healing of pressure ulcers.</p>
<p>Bone scans, CT and MRI scans may be necessary to assess the extent of
involvement of underlying structures. Angiography and Doppler ultrasound
to assess the perfusion status may also be necessary in some cases.</p>
<p><em>Treatment:</em> Prevention and minimisation of the risk factors, by
identification and pressure relieving, are the corner stone of
treatment. Proper positioning, pressure relief practice and hygiene are
crucial for pressure ulcer prevention and healing. Pressure mapping and
wheelchair and cushion review may be necessary in identifying “at risk”
patients.</p>
<p>Conditions contributing to the development of pressure sores and/or
delaying their healing should be identified and treated. Once developed,
complete pressure relief from the ulcer until the ulcer is completely
healed is essential. The patient will require regular manual positional
changes every 2 hours and the use of pressure relieving support
surfaces. This is recommended in order to prevent the development of new
pressure sores elsewhere.</p>
<p>Nutritional assessment is vital. A high protein level with zinc
supplement to correct hypoalbuminaemia may be required, or a low zinc
level and indeed blood transfusions may be indicated to correct anaemia
associated with hypoproteinaemia.</p>
<p>All ulcers are likely to be colonised not necessarily infected, thus
monitoring with wound swabs for culture and sensitivity should be
considered. Antibiotic therapy is rarely required unless the patient
develops cellulitis, osteomyelitis, pyrexia or the wound grows beta
haemolytic streptococci. Topical antibiotics are rarely used and
inadvisable. Debridement of necrotic tissue is essential for optimal
wound healing. Cellulitis or osteomyelitis requires IV antibiotic
therapy. A surgical consultation is likely to be required if
osteomyelitis develops.</p>
<p>Collagenase and alginate dressings promote autolytic debridement. These
are contraindicated in the presence of an active infection. Gauze
dressing promotes mechanical debridement. Vacuum assisted closure (VAC)
therapy provides excellent results for deep and heavily draining
pressure ulcers.</p>
<p>Surgical debridement may be performed at the bedside or in the theatre
depending on the likelihood of bleeding, the size of the wound, the
level of injury, the presence or absence of sensation, and the general
condition of the SCI patient. Enzymatic debridement is much slower.
Enzymatic debridement however leaves granulation tissue unharmed to
promote healing.</p>
<p>Primary excision and direct closure is possible for the majority of
small sores and for large sores that reduce in size with conservative
treatment. Closure of these sores can be achieved without significant
soft tissue loss or tension at the closure site. Primary excision and
direct closure have the advantage of not disturbing the anatomy of the
vascular supply to the skin or reducing the vascular supply within an
area of skin that would otherwise be surrounded by fibrous tissue when a
skin flap is fashioned.</p>
<p>Myocutaneous flap repair may be indicated for carefully selected elderly
patients following failed conservative measures and with advanced large
stage 3 or 4 pressure sores. The flap repairs carry high recurrence
rate. Pressure ulcers developing in a flap may not heal despite all
efforts; hence one should consider this as a last resort as the future
options for healing will be none.</p>
<p>The nutritional status must be optimised and focal spasticity should be
corrected before contemplating surgery to reduce wound dehiscence and
recurrence.</p>
<p>The postoperative care is at least as important as the surgery itself to
minimise tension and shearing close to the surgical site. Investigation
of why and how the sore developed, rigorous pressure relief protocols,
adequate assessment, and improvement of techniques of transfer from and
into the wheelchair must be in place before and after the surgery.</p>
<h3 id="psychological-aspects">Psychological Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#psychological-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In the acute stage of SCI, an individual may experience a range of
emotions such as numbness, despair, fear, resentment, denial, hope, and
anger. This emotional turmoil is often chaotic and disorganised. It may
be further complicated by the enforced state of sensory deprivation.
Anxiety and depression may become apparent in approximately one third of
individuals.</p>
<p>The frustrations associated with the physical limitations of such a
severe injury are compounded by the fact that most patients are young.
Prior to the injury the majority of the patients lived active lives,
often expressing themselves through physical activities. Elderly
patients find equal difficulty in adjusting following a life of physical
and mental independence.</p>
<p>The sudden realisation that one is no longer able to continue living in
the manner one was accustomed to and that one needs to lead a more
ordered, physically and mentally demanding life can result in difficult
and prolonged periods of adjustment. Failure to recognise that this
process can continue for as long as two or three years may negatively
influence the process of rehabilitation and the patient’s coping
strategies and ability to readjust. The patient needs time to come to
terms with a new status and to make decisions about the future without
undue pressure.</p>
<p>Detection of these psychological problems is vital in order to tailor
the management process to the individual patient. Peer support and
advice from well-adjusted individuals with a similar level and density
of spinal cord lesion, similar educational and/or vocational background,
and with a few years of experience of life with a spinal cord injury is
in our experience essential in managing SCI patients. We believe this to
be the most effective psychological support a newly injured patient can
benefit from. This supervised peer support not only inspires hope, by
demonstrating that there is light at the end of the tunnel, but it also
motivates and helps the process of physical, mental, psychological and
emotional readjustment as well as social reintegration. It invariably
helps with either social, recreational, or vocational reintegration,
employment or a combination of many or all of these.<sup id="fnref7:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Other problems that may be present include: pre-injury behavioural,
psychological or mental health problems, cognitive malfunction
associated with concomitant head injury, post-traumatic stress disorder,
in which an individual continually relives their accident, prolonged
periods of depression, anxiety, aggression, or lack of cooperation with
the treatment and rehabilitation. The role of the psychologist cannot be
underestimated for this relatively small group of patients.</p>
<p>Detection of these problems and the provision of psychological therapy
will enable the majority of individuals to overcome them, and to reduce
the difficulties in the process of rehabilitation. The partner and
family members invariably experience psychological difficulties and
equally benefit from support and intervention.</p>
<p>A holistic approach, including a psychological perspective, will not
only benefit the patient and the family by enhancing the rehabilitation
process, but will also help the patient to regain dignity, readjust,
reintegrate into the community and society in general, and compete for
and regain employment.<sup id="fnref8:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Management of the Upper Limbs and Hands in the Early Stages</strong></p>
<p><strong>Following Injury</strong></p>
<p>Upper limb orthosis are used to protect, support, and improve the
function of the arm, forearm and hand. They play an important role to
maximise the use of the upper limbs in the tetraplegic individuals.
Fortunately today, the trained therapists involved with the tetraplegic
patients in the early days following injury are aware of the need for
protective splinting to avoid development of contractures of the upper
limb joints. Early measurement, fabrication, and fitting of a functional
orthosis will facilitate the process of rehabilitation. The grip
patterns, measured using a standard dynamometer, are useful to evaluate
the progress.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Limb Orthosis are Used in Tetraplegic Individuals for the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Following Reasons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To support the wrist and hand in a functional position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support a flail wrist and/or hand joints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent overstretching of the finger flexor muscles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To strengthen weak muscles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To correct deformity, such as a claw hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent joint contractures, such as an elbow flexion contracture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To facilitate function</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Orthosis can be divided into two main categories: static orthosis for
position, and dynamic orthosis for function. Static wrist and hand
orthosis are used to help prevent deformity and are designed to maintain
thumb opposition, thumb web space and palmar arch, as well as proper
angulation between the hand and forearm. This is especially important in
the first month following injury, when motor power return is greatest.
Dynamic orthosis, such as the wrist-driven wrist-hand orthosis, provide
prehension to increase independence in activities of daily living. In
practice, externally powered systems are difficult to maintain. Current
designs utilise simple, lightweight mechanical components which are
lighter and more easily maintained.</p>
<p>Assessment of the function of the hand, whether the tenodesis action is
functional and/or whether it could be enhanced through splinting, is
essential to help the therapist and the patient choose the optimal
orthosis for enhancing function.</p>
<p>Initially, the patient with high cervical (C1 to C4) injury is fitted
with a prefabricated, soft, resting hand splint. In cases where a more
permanent hand orthosis is needed, the static wrist-hand orthosis can be
used. The orthosis helps to reduce the risk of contracture and
deformity. This is accomplished by supporting the wrist in a functional
position, with the hand and wrist in approximately 20 to 30 degrees of
extension and holding the thumb in a position of abduction. The orthosis
is contoured into the palmar arch of the hand to maintain its shape.
This allows a position appropriate for many functional activities in the
event of later motor return.</p>
<p>In individuals with C4/C5 level injuries, to prevent hand deformity the
patient must wear a static orthosis at night. To prevent elbow range of
motion restrictions, an elbow extension orthosis, which keeps the elbow
in extension against an unopposed biceps, may be worn at night. Some
static orthosis also incorporate a means of attaching tools to allow for
increased function. In individuals with C5 level injuries, the wrist is
positioned in a static orthosis in a functional position to maximise the
potential for future function due to progressive recovery in the
muscles. A position of natural finger flexion facilitates the
development of flexor tendon tightness on which tenodesis function
relies.</p>
<p>The orthotic management is similar for C6/7 level injuries. At the C6
level, the patient will have intact wrist extensors along with the
serratus anterior and clavicular pectoral muscles. Intact wrist
extensors allow tenodesis action at the wrist to accomplish dynamic
prehension for feeding, hygiene and similar activities.</p>
<p>Individuals with C8 level injuries have intact finger extrinsic muscles,
but have weak or absent intrinsic muscles. The activity of the long
flexors in the absence of lumbricals creates a claw hand deformity.
Prehension without initial metacarpophalangeal joint flexion becomes
less effective. A static hand orthosis with a MP extension stop, such as
a lumbrical bar, helps to substitute for the intrinsic minus hand. An
additional thumb post orthosis maintains the web space and thumb in the
opposition position.</p>
<h3 id="respiratory-care-in-acute-cervical-spinal-cord-injury">Respiratory Care in Acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury<a class="headerlink" href="#respiratory-care-in-acute-cervical-spinal-cord-injury" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Respiratory dysfunction is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in
SCI. The level and completeness of injury are the main determinants of
the extent of respiratory dysfunction. Other concomitant injuries and
comorbidities not incorporated here will have further detrimental
impacts. It is essential to ensure full aeration of the lungs with
proactive chest clearance of secretions regimens and monitoring to
prevent secondary hypoxic damage to the spinal cord.</p>
<p><strong>The Minimum Basic Strategies with Complete Lesions Should Include the
Following to Ensure Large Volume Ventilation of the Lungs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoid unnecessary intubation for ventilation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid early verticalisation or mobilisation of the patient before
    recovery from spinal shock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain the supine lying position for maximal spontaneous tidal
    volume exchange, irrespective of the patient breathing spontaneously
    or being intubated and ventilated. This should continue throughout
    the weaning process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an abdominal binder when the patient is upright and until the
    patient recovers completely from spinal shock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek guidance and support from the specialised spinal cord injury
    centre as soon as cord damage is suspected or diagnosed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Respiratory insufficiency, common after Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) but
especially in cervical cord injuries, is a major cause of morbidity and
mortality. The more rostral and complete the damage to the spinal cord,
the greater the likelihood of major respiratory impairment. Around 40%
of spinal cord injuries occur in the cervical spine, a trend that is
steadily increasing, with respiratory causes being responsible for death
in over 20% of individuals.<sup id="fnref:41"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:41">41</a></sup> Loss of lung volumes and
relative hypoxaemia contribute to global hypoxaemia, exacerbating cord
ischaemia in the acute period.<sup id="fnref:36"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:36">36</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:37"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:37">37</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:38"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:38">38</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:39"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:39">39</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:40"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:40">40</a></sup>  Respiratory

of up to 70%<sup id="fnref2:38"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:38">38</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2:39"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:39">39</a></sup> , ineffective cough and secretion clearance
abilities<sup id="fnref2:42"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:42">42</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:43"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:43">43</a></sup> , reductions in both lung and chest wall
compliance; and an additional oxygen cost of breathing due to changes in
respiratory mechanics, with obstructive sleep apnoea evident in over 50%
of acute tetraplegics.<sup id="fnref:44"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:44">44</a></sup> While some countries have specialist
spinal units to manage such catastrophic trauma with a demonstrable
improvement in health outcomes attributed to their
contribution<sup id="fnref:45"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:45">45</a></sup>, many individuals are initially admitted to
local hospitals where healthcare professionals are less likely to fully
appreciate the significant and continued vulnerabilities of such
individuals. This section is aimed at providing a basic understanding of
the causes and identification of the main principles of the respiratory
management strategies required to maintain pulmonary health for cervical
SCI patients during the initial and early post-trauma phase.</p>
<p><strong>Respiratory Mechanics</strong></p>
<p>Complete injuries above the midthoracic region will result in loss of
the major respiratory muscle groups for both inspiration and expiration
and thus an inability to either fully aerate the lungs or to clear
pulmonary secretions, resulting in major vulnerabilities toward
pulmonary collapse and infection. Intercostals and abdominal muscle
paralysis result in paradoxical chest wall motion i.e. the thorax is
pulled in while the hypercompliant abdomen moves out, with loss of
diaphragmatic excursion through the zone of apposition.<sup id="fnref:46"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:46">46</a></sup> The
upright sitting posture results in lower lung volumes than supine
lying<sup id="fnref2:46"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:46">46</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:47"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:47">47</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:48"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:48">48</a></sup>  since the diaphragm loses its ability to
generate the same force of contraction. Thus while somewhat
counterintuitive to the respiratory clinician, the supine position
should be adopted in times of respiratory compromise/distress and
throughout the process of weaning from mechanical ventilation in
complete cord lesions. The use of abdominal binders, applied over the
lower ribs and abdomen, is common practise in the specialist centres for
use in the upright position<sup id="fnref2:13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup>, improving the VC by as much as
0.32 litres.<sup id="fnref:49"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:49">49</a></sup> This application may, in borderline cases,
offset the need for respiratory support.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment and Management Strategies</strong></p>
<p><em>Atelectasis and pneumonia</em> pose a significant morbidity risk and are
reported in 40-70% of cases. Respiratory assessment should be vigilant,
simple and repeated frequently at the bedside to warn of impending or
frank respiratory failure. As a minimum, the <em>Vital Capacity</em> (VC),
Respiratory Rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) should all
be monitored regularly, and their trends considered, preferably with
arterial blood gases (ABGs) performed at frequent intervals during the
first few weeks post injury. Pulse oximetry alone may be falsely
reassuring in cases of slow and silent respiratory muscle pump failure,
so consideration of the respiratory component of the acid base status
requires arterial sampling.</p>
<p>The motor function of the respiratory muscle is not specifically
considered in the formal neurological assessments. However, since the
diaphragm is innervated at C3, 4, and 5, upper limb assessment may be
indicative of diaphragmatic presence or loss of function.</p>
<p>The initial reduction of VC in the acute phase will increase steadily
within the first five weeks post injury.<sup id="fnref2:36"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:36">36</a></sup> While a reduction
in VC to 10ml/kg body weight is accepted, further reductions due to loss
of compliance or increased resistance (e.g. atelectasis and/or
infection), will cause rapid deterioration while a peak cough flow rate
(which reduces with lower VCs) of at least 160l/s is essential to shear
mucus along the airway walls, for airway clearance.<sup id="fnref:50"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:50">50</a></sup> The
provision of assisted cough to increase the mucus clearance
ability<sup id="fnref:51"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:51">51</a></sup>, either manually or mechanically<sup id="fnref:52"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:52">52</a></sup>, is
vital in reducing the risk of pulmonary complications and subsequent
respiratory failure.</p>
<p>A VC\&lt;1 litre may be inadequate to sustain spontaneous breathing and is
a major indicator to provide ventilatory support. Prompt support with
Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) may enable the avoidance of invasive
tracheal intubation in acute SCI.<sup id="fnref:53"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:53">53</a></sup> However, halo fixation
may pose particular difficulties with mask fitting for NIV therapy.
Other risks associated with NIV in a nonspecialised spinal unit include
the ASCI patient being susceptible to profound and rapid desaturation,
silent fall into respiratory failure, paralytic ileus, risk of air
swallowing and an increased risk of acute vomiting and aspiration. The
loss of arm and hand function must not be forgotten when selecting the
NIV interface.</p>
<p><em>Neurological deficits</em> may be asymmetrical so the all-important
diaphragm should be considered as two separate halves. Paralysis of a
single hemidiaphragm in a complete cervical spine injury, which may go
unnoticed by the untrained eye, may require longer term or at least
part-time respiratory support, since all intercostal and abdominal
muscle activity will be lost (Recently, a crossed phrenic nerve pathway
has been identified, thought to be able to support the contralateral
diaphragm, though the clinical implications of this have not yet been
fully explored).<sup id="fnref:54"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:54">54</a></sup> Where diaphragm function is uncertain,
more detailed assessment using the useful tools of fluoroscopic
screening, M mode ultrasound<sup id="fnref:56"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:56">56</a></sup>, and surface EMG should be
carried out.<sup id="fnref:55"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:55">55</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Aspiration</em> poses a significant risk to the tetraplegic patient.
Kirshblum et al<sup id="fnref:57"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:57">57</a></sup> studied 187 acute SCI patients. Of these,
42 had signs of aspiration with video fluoroscopic confirmation in
31cases. Kirshblum’s independent predictors of dysphagia by VFSS were
tracheostomy tube at the time of admission, recent cervical spine
surgery particularly with an anterior approach, and age. Clinically,
aspiration often goes unnoticed but may present as repeated respiratory
infections or repeated/persistent lobar collapses. Assessment of
swallowing, with speech and language therapist input, is vital as
salivary and/or food aspiration can have a major detrimental impact upon
respiratory health and complicate the ongoing management. Medications
should be reviewed due to the effects of some on muscle fibres e.g.
corticosteroids and lipid-lowering agents. The profound psychological
impact of denying oral intake in the longer term, in a high SCI
individual, should not be overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Invasive Mechanical Ventilation and Weaning</strong></p>
<p>The likelihood of a tracheostomy requirement for ventilation
post-surgical fixation<sup id="fnref:58"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:58">58</a></sup> is increasingly common outside the
specialist centres. When diaphragm function is lost, invasive mechanical
ventilatory support is essential, though recovery has been seen to occur
as late as 12 months post injury<sup id="fnref:59"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:59">59</a></sup>. Regardless of the timing,
the method of ventilation for SCIs requires larger tidal
volumes<sup id="fnref2:37"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:37">37</a></sup> (at least 10-15mls/kg), to ensure effective
aeration of the lung bases and avoidance of atelectasis and infection.
This is well tolerated by SCI patients, with no known evidence to
demonstrate pulmonary damage in the absence of acute lung injury. The
effect of large volume ventilation is that of respiratory alkalosis,
with no long term detrimental effect from this.<sup id="fnref:60"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:60">60</a></sup> Electrolyte
monitoring in the acute stabilisation phase is required.</p>
<p>The discontinuation of mechanical ventilatory support is likely to take
some weeks to achieve. Consistent factors underpinning successful
weaning after spinal cord damage have been attributed to accurate
neurological assessment; prevention of pulmonary atelectasis by
physiotherapy; ventilator free breathing (VFB) graduated according to
VC; rest periods with controlled ventilation; cuff deflation allowing
translaryngeal air flow; and regular tracheostomy tube
changes.<sup id="fnref:61"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:61">61</a></sup> It may be useful to highlight the significant
incidence of sleep apnoea (both central and obstructive in nature) in
tetraplegic patients immediately post injury<sup id="fnref2:44"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:44">44</a></sup>, which
increases over time<sup id="fnref2:61"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:61">61</a></sup>, as this is likely to complicate the
respiratory picture and even delay weaning if unrecognised.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI) are potentially catastrophic
injuries. With good simultaneous management of the injured spine, and
support for the family members, the multisystem malfunction and the
psychological, social, emotional, financial, vocational, environmental
and economic consequences of the spinal cord injury and its effects can
be minimised. A significant majority of patients with incomplete
paralysis can recover walking. Patients who do not recover, can, with
ongoing expert monitoring care and support, lead healthy, fulfilling,
fruitful, competitive lives and participate again in
society.<sup id="fnref9:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup></p>
