Pieri-Davies, W.S. El Masri(y) Epidemiology \u00b6 Demographic characteristics: The annual incidence of spinal cord injury varies between countries. In the USA for the past two decades it has remained unchanged at 40 per million population per year 1 . Elsewhere it usually does not exceed 20 new cases per million population per year. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 In the UK the incidence ranges from 10 to 15 per million population per year. In recent years there has been an increase in the proportion of injuries to the cervical spinal cord, with more tetraplegic patients than paraplegics being admitted to hospital. Race: There has been a trend in the incidence in various ethnic groups in the USA with an increase in Afro-Caribbean and a decrease in the White population. Currently the incidence is 63% among Caucasian, 22.7% Afro-Caribbean, 11.8% in the Hispanic population and fewer than 2% in the Asian population. 9 Sex: Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) occurs predominantly among men, the male-to-female ratio is approximately 4:1. Age: SCI incidence rates are lowest for the paediatric age group, highest for persons in their late teens and early twenties, and declines thereafter. The average age at injury is 39.5 years. About 3.5% occur in children aged below 15 years of age. There has been an increasing incidence of spinal cord injury in persons older than 60 years (11.5%). 9 Prevalence: Although the incidence reflects the number of new cases that occur each year, prevalence is defined as the number of persons with a SCI who are currently alive. In the UK it is estimated that there are 40,000 persons with SCI. The prevalence of SCI in the USA is estimated to be between 721 and 906 per million populations. The Stockholm study reported a prevalence rate of 227 per million. Causes of spinal cord injury: Overall, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI); the most common causes of SCI remain motor vehicle accidents (42%), falls (27.1%), interpersonal violence (15.3%) and sports (7.4%). Other non-traumatic causes of SCI include vascular disorders, tumours, inflammation, infection, demyelinating diseases, disc prolapse, iatrogenic injuries including spinal injections and epidural catheter placement, vertebral fractures secondary to osteoporosis, Vitamin B12 deficiency, congenital and developmental disorders. Effects and Special Characteristics of Spinal Cord Injury 10 \u00b6 Traumatic spinal cord injuries are potentially catastrophic injuries. Their medical and nonmedical effects can be devastating if not adequately and simultaneously managed. SCI causes generalised physiological impairment and multisystem malfunctions that depend on the reflex activity of the spinal cord segments distal to the lesion. Changes in the level of reflex activity of the spinal cord occur throughout the patient\u2019s life with often unpredictable changes in function of the various body systems. Each system malfunction is a source of multiple disabilities and a potential source of a wide variety and range of complications. For example impairment of bladder functions can result in urinary incontinence, detrusor overactivity, urinary infections, hydronephrosis and renal failure. When a complication develops, the loss of the co-ordinating and moderating functions of the brain usually results in a cascade of intersystem effects that are rarely seen in other conditions. These are rarely easy to manage. For example, an anal fissure, while painless in these patients can nevertheless cause excess spasticity which in turn may cause a fall and fracture of a long bone. Alternatively, excess spasticity involving the pelvic floor muscles can result in urinary retention, autonomic dysreflexia with devastating symptoms and signs, and possibly cerebrovascular accident. Conventional symptoms and signs of pathology are absent because of sensory impairment or loss below the injury. This can result in delay of diagnosis usually with unpleasant consequences. Adding the number of disabilities and potential complications to the various system impairments, one can easily appreciate the magnitude of the burden to the patient, partner, carers, and the team responsible for the treatment, rehabilitation and education of the patient. Almost all complications following SCI are preventable and when developed their effects can be minimised. The nonmedical effects of SCI are equally devastating to patients and family members. The importance of planning the management programme, including frequent reassessments, re-calibration and modification of the programme, according to the level of the reflex activity of the spinal cord and the various levels of functionality of the various systems of the body throughout the patient\u2019s life cannot be overemphasised. The only difference in the requirement for monitoring between the acute stage and the long term is the frequency of the monitoring. Fortunately, the incidence of spinal cord injuries is the lowest of all major trauma injuries. A general hospital serving a population of 250,000 in the UK is likely to receive fewer than four newly injured patients per year. The competencies of clinicians and allied professionals required for adequate expert multidisciplinary management of SCI patients cannot be developed to adequately manage such complex conditions in general hospitals with such small numbers of patients. The management of SCI patients is therefore safer, more efficient and more cost-effective in Spinal Injuries Centres (SIC) equipped with the infrastructure of equipment, knowledge, skills and expertise of adequately trained multidisciplinary teams when compared to general hospitals. Furthermore, SIC, where large numbers of patients are treated, are able to provide supervised peer support, which is of incalculable value in the facilitation of the management and psychological well-being of patients with SCI. Classification Terminology \u00b6 SCI can be broadly classified as complete or incomplete. This is a pathological definition. The diagnosis of complete SCI cannot be made however until the stage of spinal cord shock resolves. It is therefore prudent, until the reflexes return, to describe the clinical presentation as complete sensory and motor loss or as incomplete loss of either or both modalities. Once the tendon reflexes return, if there is still no motor or sensory function below the injury, by definition the injury is complete. If, following the return of the reflexes, the patient has only some motor power or sensation below the level of injury, the patient is considered to be sensory incomplete. If the reflexes have returned and the patient has both some motor function and sensation below the level of injury, the patient is also considered to be incomplete. The Incomplete SCI Syndromes are Classified Clinically as Follows \u00b6 Central Cord Syndrome (CCS): Central Cord Syndrome is caused by a spinal cord lesion in the centre of the cord, usually involving a cervical lesion, with greater motor weakness in the upper extremities than in the lower extremities. The falls and the motor vehicle collisions are the most common causes, followed by cervical canal stenosis with extension injury, intramedullary haematoma, mass or syrinx. CCS is the most common of the SCI syndromes. It classically affects the elderly, and C4 and C5 are the most common levels affected. Sensory loss is variable and the patient is more likely to lose pain and/or temperature sensation than joint position or vibration. Dysaesthesia (sensation of burning in the hands or arms), especially in the upper extremities is common. Sacral sensory sparing usually exists. Frankel D is the most common impairment score. Diagnosis is supported by MRI evidence of signal changes in the centre of the cervical cord. The prognosis of CCS is considered favourable for functional recovery, especially in those below the age of 50. The clinical outcomes are significantly worse in patients aged 70 years or older. 11 The lower extremities recover first and to a greater extent. Similarly distal muscle recovery is greater in the upper limbs with intrinsic muscle recovery in the hands occuring before recovery of shoulder muscles. Following the initial period of supervised bed rest, treatment involves splinting of the hands in a functional position, strengthening and Range of Motion (ROM) exercises, trunk balance, posture stabilisation, and ADL and mobility training with appropriate assistive devices. Surgery may be indicated if there are symptoms or signs of progressive neurological deficits. Brown-Sequard Syndrome (BSS): Brown-Sequard Syndrome is an incomplete lesion in the spinal cord involving a relatively greater loss of proprioception and motor function on the same side of the spinal cord damage, along with loss of pain and temperature sensation in the opposite half of the cord damage. Horner\u2019s syndrome may be present and this is due to the involvement of the sympathetic tracts. BSS is classically seen in stab injuries and bullet wounds involving hemisection of the spinal cord, and it is also seen with most other causes of the traumatic spinal cord injury. On examination there is ipsilateral weakness and sensory loss for proprioception (vibration and touch) with preservation of pain and temperature sensation. Contralateral motor power and proprioception are preserved but pain and temperature sensations are impaired. Most patients (up to 90%) will gain mobility. Recovery is common in proximal extensors followed by the distal flexors. Anterior Cord Syndrome (ACS): Anterior Cord Syndrome involves impairment of motor function and pain and/or temperature sensation, with preservation of proprioception (touch, two point discrimination and vibration sense). ACS is seen in lesions affecting the anterior two thirds of the spinal cord sparing the posterior columns. ACS can occur at any level of the spinal cord. Common causes are vascular insufficiency or obstruction to the anterior spinal artery, mechanical compression from stenosis and trauma. Risk factors include aortic or spinal surgery, hyperflexion injury, atherosclosis and thrombotic disorders. MRI, angiography and screening for hypercoagulation status usually establishes the clinical diagnosis. Treatment in addition to management of the causes is similar to other incomplete syndromes. Functional electrical stimulation and Botulinum toxin may be indicated in selected cases for functional restoration and focal spasticity respectively. Prognosis is generally considered poor and is determined by the extent of the cord damage. About 10 to 20% however recover motor functions. Conus Medullaris Syndrome (CMS): Conus Medullaris Syndrome is a sacral cord injury with or without involvement of the lumbar nerve roots. This syndrome is characterised by areflexia in the bladder, bowel, and to a lesser degree, lower limbs. Motor and sensory loss in the lower limbs is variable, being typically bilateral but may be asymmetric. It can manifest as sciatica, saddle anaesthesia, or bowel and bladder areflexia. Prognosis is generally considered poor. Individuals with complete perineal anaesthesia are less likely to recover natural bladder functions. Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES): Cauda Equina Syndrome involves injury to the lumbosacral nerve roots within the neural canal and is characterised by areflexic bowels and/or bladder, with variable motor and sensory loss in the lower limbs. This injury is usually caused by a central lumbar disc prolapse, or following lumbar epidural injections. Because this syndrome is a nerve root injury rather than a true spinal cord injury, the affected limbs are areflexic. Clean intermittent self-catheterisation and manual bowel evacuation regimes are likely to be required for the management of the neuropathic bladder and bowels. Ankle foot orthosis are useful for ankle weakness to aid ambulation. Physical Examination \u00b6 The initial clinical evaluation begins with a primary survey. The primary survey focuses on life-threatening conditions. Assessment of airways, breathing, and circulation takes precedence. A spinal cord injury must be considered concurrently following any major trauma. The clinical assessment of pulmonary function in acute spinal cord injury begins with a careful history regarding respiratory symptoms and a review of underlying cardiopulmonary comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure. Evaluation also includes respiratory rate, chest wall expansion, abdominal wall movement, force of cough, chest, limbs and other associated injuries according to a detailed secondary survey. Arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry are especially useful because the bedside diagnosis of hypoxia or carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention may be difficult. The degree of respiratory dysfunction depends on pre-existing pulmonary status, the level of SCI, and any associated chest wall or lung injury. The pulmonary function may be impaired in SCI as a result of loss of ventilatory muscle function from denervation, lung injury, such as pneumothorax, haemothorax, or pulmonary contusion, and decreased central ventilatory drive that is associated with head injury or the effects of alcohol and drugs. The axial skeleton should be examined to identify and provide initial treatment of potentially unstable spinal fractures from both a mechanical and a neurological basis. The cervical spine and paraspinal tissues should be evaluated for pain, swelling, bruising, or malalignment during palpation. Logrolling the patient to systematically examine each spinous process of the entire axial skeleton from the occiput to the sacrum can help identify and localise injury. In all patients, a careful, complete and detailed neurological assessment, including motor function, sensory evaluation, deep tendon reflexes, and perineal evaluation including the deep anal sensation with per rectal examination, is critical to establish the presence or absence of SCI, the level of injury, the density of the cord damage and to classify the lesion according to a specific cord syndrome. Complete bilateral loss of sensation or motor function below a certain level indicates a complete SCI. The presence or absence of sacral sparing can be a key prognostic indicator. Neurological Classification \u00b6 Clinicians have used the Frankel classification to grade the severity of neurological loss. 12 Frankel in 1969 classified the density of the neurological lesion into five categories 12 according to the presence or absence of normal neurology, and if the neurology is abnormal according to the presence or absence of motor power or sensation below the level of injury. The Frankel Grading System 12 \u00b6 1. \u2018Complete\u2019 (Frankel - A): This means that the lesion is found to be complete, both motor and sensory, below the segmental level marked. If there is an alteration of level but the lesion remains complete below the new level, then the arrow points up or down the \u2018complete\u2019 column. 2. \u2018Sensory only\u2019 (Frankel \u2013 B): This implies that there is some sensation present below the level of lesion but that the motor paralysis is complete below that level. This column does not apply when there is a slight discrepancy between the motor and sensory level but does apply to sacral sparing. 3. \u2018Motor Useless\u2019 (Frankel - C): This implies that there is some motor power present below the lesion but it is of no practical use to the patient. 4. \u2018Motor Useful\u2019 (Frankel - D): This implies that there is useful motor power below the level of the lesion. Patients in this group can move the lower limbs and many can walk, with or without aids. 5. \u2018Recovery\u2019 (Frankel - E): This implies that the patient is free of neurological symptoms, i.e. no weakness, no sensory loss, no sphincter disturbance. Abnormal reflexes may be present. The Frankel classification system is still the most widely used classification by the clinicians from all the disciplines. The advantage of the Frankel classification is that with a single letter of the alphabet, it can describe both the density of neurological damage at a particular level, the presence or absence of sparing, and the type of sparing (motor and/or sensory) below the level of the injury. Any significant effect of treatment resulting in change of neurology can be easily described by repeating the neurological assessment, and documented by using a letter of the alphabet from A to E. The Frankel classification is not however sensitive enough to elicit small changes in the neurology to move from one grade to the other, but it remains the most practical method for describing the progress of a patient or group of patients in the clinical situation. ASIA Classification \u00b6 In 1982, based on the Frankel classification, the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) first published standards for neurological classification of patients with spinal cord injury. 13 In 1992, The International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS, formerly IMSoP) adopted these guidelines to create true international standards. Further refinements have been adopted including assessment of autonomic functions. The American Spinal Injury Association has established pertinent definitions. The neurological level of injury is the lowest (most caudal) level with normal sensory and motor function. For example, a patient with C6 quadriplegia has, by definition, abnormal motor and sensory function in C7 and possibly C8 & T1. The ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) follows the Frankel scale but differs in several important respects. First, instead of no function below the injury level, AIS - A is defined as a person with no motor or sensory function preserved in the sacral segments S4-S5. This definition is clear and unambiguous. There could be sensory and motor functions in both the myotomes and the dermatomes of long tracts between the cervical spinal cord and S3, but the pathology would still be described as a complete AIS - A cervical lesion. Such a patient in other words would be described as incomplete Frankel B but according to the ASIA classification he/she would be described as complete AIS-A. AIS-B is essentially identical to Frankel B but adds the requirement of preserved sacral S4-S5 function. It should be noted that AIS - A and B classification depend entirely on a single observation, i.e. the preservation of motor and sensory function of S4-5. In other words, a sensory incomplete Frankel B patient will not be considered as having long tract sparing below a C5 lesion if he/she did have sensory sparing to S2 or S3 but not S4-S5. ASIA stipulated that a patient would be an AIS-C if more than half of the muscles evaluated had a grade of less than 3/5. If more than half of the muscles evaluated had a grade of more than 3, the person was assigned to AIS-D. AIS-E is spinal column injury without any detectable neurological deficit on a neurological examination. The ASIA classified incomplete spinal cord injuries into five types, Central Cord Syndrome, Brown-Sequard Syndrome, Anterior Cord Syndrome, Conus Medullaris and Cauda Equina Syndrome. *The American Spinal Injury Association recommends the use of the following (from MRC - Medical Research Council) scale for the assessment of motor strength: * 0 - No contraction or movement 1 - Minimal movement 2 - Active movement, but not against gravity 3 - Active movement against gravity 4 - Active movement against resistance 5 - Active movement against full resistance The key muscles that need to be tested to establish the neurological level are as follows: Upper limb Biceps C5 Wrist extensors C6 Triceps C7 Long finger flexors C8 Small finger abductors T1 Lower limb Hip flexors L2 Knee extensors L3 Ankle dorsiflexors L4 Extensor Hallucis L5 Ankle plantar flexors S1 The sacral roots are evaluated by documenting the following: Perineal sensation to light touch and pinprick Bulbocavernous reflex (S3 or S4) Anal wink (S5) Rectal tone and anal sensation Urine retention or incontinence Priapism It must be appreciated that neither the Frankel nor the ASIA classification specifies the response of sensory appreciation to testing with a pin. We believe it is relevant to differentiate between the patient feeling the pin as \u201cpin prick\u201d and feeling the pin as \u201cdeep touch\u201d considering that these are likely to have different prognostic values. 16, 17, 18 Management of Spinal Injuries \u00b6 The primary objectives in the management of SCI patients include minimising the neurological damage caused during the primary injury and also preventing further injury to the damaged cord secondary to hypoperfusion, ischaemia, biochemical and inflammatory changes. Active Physiological Conservative Management (APCM) 10 is based on these objectives; it is the active simultaneous, nonsurgical management, from the early hours of injury, of the injured spine, of the multisystem neurogenic effects of spinal cord injury on respiratory, cardiovascular, urinary, gastrointestinal, dermatological, sexual, and reproductive functions, and of the associated psychological effects, rehabilitation and environmental modifications. During APCM, containment of the biomechanical instability is safely maintained in recumbency for 4-6 weeks followed by bracing during mobilisation for a further six weeks. All patients with SCI are removed from the long spinal board within twenty minutes of arrival at the emergency department or as soon as possible. Patients are moved and handled in such as a way as to prevent secondary spinal cord lesions due to inappropriate mechanical forces and to prevent pressure area damage. All patients with a spinal cord injury and/or complex and multiple spinal column injuries are managed on a spinal bed within 24hrs. Spinal column alignment is maintained throughout all turns, procedures and transfer manoeuvres. All patients are closely monitored for neurological change and pressure area protection. All patients will have a regime of 2-3 hourly spinal logroll turns established as soon as is practical following admission. Patients are left in the turned position on their side for a maximum of 3 hours, or as long as the patient tolerates it, whichever is shorter. Unless contraindicated by other injuries, within the first 24hrs post injury, nursing staff can provide a twice daily range of passive exercises for the hands and feet, supported by regular repositioning to prevent equinus and upper limb and finger contractures. This should commence with placing the feet in a 90\u02da resting position, using pillows and avoiding force. The hands are positioned on small pillows. For the tetraplegic patients, shoulders are kept in the abducted position and alternate arms are raised at each turn. All spinal cord injured patients are kept nil by mouth for at least 48hrs, and commenced on Proton Pump Inhibitors as soon as possible for prevention of gastrointestinal stress ulcers. A light diet, or enteral or parenteral feeding, is introduced gradually when bowel sounds return to normal. Patients are referred to a dietician for assessment and nutritional support within 72hrs. Bowel regime is instigated on admission and this is modified according to individual response. As all acute SCI patients present with definitive neurological bladder dysfunction, the paralysed bladder is at significant risk of nosocomial infection. It is therefore of paramount importance to prevent bladder distension and catheter blockage. All patients are catheterised on admission with a size 12 \u2013 16 gauge catheter. Indwelling catheters should be maintained on free drainage and changed at least weekly. Once the patient is stable and fluid balance is within acceptable limits the indwelling catheter should be removed and patients are commenced on a 4 hourly intermittent catheterisation. To prevent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, anticoagulation therapy is appropriately established within 48hrs. All SCI patients are fitted with properly sized thigh length TED stockings. Foot pumps or compression boots can be used, but it is important to monitor the pressure effect on the neuropathic skin in an SCI individual. Physiotherapists are involved at the earliest opportunity with a view to providing an assessment of limb movements. SCI patients can present with spinal shock which can compromise their cardiovascular status and stability. The underlying pathogenesis is the loss of the baroreceptor reflex and basal sympathetic tone in high spinal cord lesions. Also the treating team should be aware of the fact that logrolling and repositioning may cause stimulation of the vagus nerve. Atropine, usually 0.3 - 0.6 mgs, may be required to treat syncope attacks associated with bradycardia when the heart rate is below 35. Intravenous fluids are administered judiciously to prevent fluid overload. The patient\u2019s core temperature is closely monitored as SCI patients may not be able to internally regulate their body temperature, depending on the level and extent of injury. In cervical injuries the neck is secured with a rigid cervical collar and sandbags are placed on each side of the head. It is important to note that cervical collars alone are ineffective in minimising motion, both flexion and extension, of the injured cervical spine. The most commonly used collars are the Philadelphia or Miami J collars, but these are not appropriate for long-term stabilisation. Cervical collars allow 30 to 65% of normal motion. Cervical spine immobilisation is best achieved with a Halo device; this only permits less than 5% of normal cervical spine motion. Many cervical spine injuries can be treated without surgery. Immobilisation in a rigid cervical orthosis for 8 to 12 weeks is usually sufficient. For a stable cervical spine injury without compression of the neural elements, a rigid cervical brace or Halo vest system for 8 to 12 weeks usually produces a stable, painless spine without any residual deformity. Facet dislocations following reduction in traction may be immobilised in a halo vest for 8 to 12 weeks. Before mobilisation, all spinal injuries, with or without neurological deficits, should be evaluated clinically for localised tenderness and radiologic with dynamic radiographs in the flexion and extension positions. The ultimate goals of APCM management are to ensure maximum neurological recovery and independence, a pain-free flexible spine, safe functioning of the various systems of the body with minimal or no inconvenience to patients, and prevention or minimisation of complications. The great majority of injuries become biomechanically stable and pain free. Unfortunately surgery has become the preferred method of management, also known as the \u201cStandard of Care\u201d, of traumatic spinal injuries. Currently, about 80% of patients with TSCI are surgically decompressed and stabilised without the rigours of adequate research methodology or demonstration of superiority of neurological and/or other outcomes over APCM. Currently, resources are relatively easily found for surgical implants and surgical procedures in both the developing and developed world. However, it is increasingly difficult to find resources for the management of the effects of the SCI and the rehabilitation of the patient in both the acute stage and in the long term. There is no evidence to suggest that surgical stabilisation enhances the speed of healing or achieves stability earlier than with APCM. Admittedly the incidence of kyphotic deformities is lower following surgical stabilisation than following APCM, however the large majority of these kyphotic deformities are painless. The discrepancy between deformity and pain has been known for some time. Painless kyphotic deformity enhances the independence of wheelchair-bound patients and is certainly preferable to a stiff, straight neck or back following surgery. There is no evidence to suggest that surgical decompression achieves better or earlier neurological recovery than APCM in humans with incomplete cord or cauda equina injury. Patients with paralysis, general physiological impairment and multisystem malfunction do not benefit from early mobilisation, which indeed may be counterproductive. Early mobilisation of patients is associated with a reduction of vital capacity and a potential drop of oxygen saturation and /or postural hypotension. Individually, or in combination, these may further impair cord functions. Early mobilisation does not result in early completion of rehabilitation nor earlier discharge of patients with SCI. Until credible evidence demonstrates superiority of outcome with one method of treatment of the injured spine over the other, patients should be encouraged to make an informed choice between the various methods of management, assuming that the patient will receive treatment in an institution that can provide equally good APCM and surgical management. Certain groups of patients are likely to benefit from surgery and should be encouraged to consider the option. Neurologically intact patients with a physiologically stable cord but unstable injured spine, the uncontrolled epileptic, the mentally-challenged, and patients who are unable to comply with bed rest, are safer following surgical stabilisation than with conservative management. Patients with biomechanical instability from pure ligamentous injuries without bony injury are at risk of developing late painful deformities and indeed may benefit from early surgery. Patients who exhibit signs of neurological deterioration with evidence of further neurological compression of neural tissues on MRI may benefit from surgical decompression. Prognostic Determinants of Recovery \u00b6 The prognostic determinants of neurological recovery have been extensively studied over the last five decades. Frankel et al in 1969 studied 682 consecutive patients admitted within 14 days of injury. 12 He divided these patients into 5 groups from Frankel A to E according to the neurological presentation 12 . He demonstrated that with Active Physiological Conservative Management (APCM) 10 about 60% of the FB patients (i.e. presenting with complete motor paralysis of lower limbs (LL) but sensory sparing) recovered significant power in the LL to resume ambulation. Patients presenting with minimal and useless LL motor sparing (FC) did better, with 78.43% recovering ambulation. These results were subsequently confirmed. 14 15 16 Since the mid-eighties El Masri(y) and colleagues have been studying qualitatively and quantitatively the prognostic value of the different sensory modalities and motor sparing in various groups of patients admitted within 72 hours from injury and treated with APCM. 10 16 17 They found that 86% of FC patients recovered significant motor power to resume ambulation. Of those presenting in the FB group with spared spinothalamic Pin Prick (PP) sensation, 71% recovered useful motor power to ambulate. However, only 33% of patients with post column sparing recovered7. El Masri(y) and colleagues also studied the prognostic value of PP appreciation in FB patients, finding that 75% of patients who felt the pin as PP and only 20% of those who felt the \u201cpin as pressure\u201d recovered ambulation. The percentage of motor points recovery in FB patients with PP sparing was 80.2% and a similar 79.6% in FC patients. 18 Rectal sensation on rectal examination was a poor predictor of recovery and only 12.5% of patients recovered ambulation16. The outcomes of these prognostic indicators were not affected by mal-alignment, spinal canal stenosis, degree of canal encroachment, degree of cord compression, or spinal column instability. 10 14 17 18 19 20 None of the patients studied had any surgical, cellular, pharmacological, biological, chemical, immunological, hormonal or other interventions. 10 19 20 21 The APCM consisted of adequate containment of both the \u201cbiomechanical instability\u201d of the spinal column and the \u201cphysiological instability\u201d of the spinal cord. 22 The injured spine and the medical and nonmedical effects of the SCI were managed with the patient in recumbency for about 6 weeks. This facilitated the prevention of complications such as hypoxia, hypotension which can cause reduction of spinal cord perfusion, hypertension which can cause increased cord haemorrhage, hypothermia, generalised sepsis, and/or severe anaemia. To date there is no evidence that neurological recovery following traumatic SCI is limited in patients over 65 years of age compared with younger patients. Their pre-existing health and mobility may however influence both capability and quality of ambulation. Patients younger than 65 years with muscle grade of 3 or greater in the myotome L3 and S1, and light touch sensation in the dermatome L3 and S1 within 15 days of injury (all within ASIA impairment scale D), are more likely to be independent indoor walkers within a year of injury. 23 Further studies are required to assess the power of the various prognostic indicators at different times from injury and their applicability to test outcomes of interventions not only for ambulation and functional recovery but also for autonomic functions such as bladder, bowel, cardiorespiratory, vasomotor, erectile and reproductive functions. 24 Early Complications Following SCI \u00b6 Deep Venous Thrombosis: \u00b6 Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE), are common complications of SCI, and continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite preventative measures the incidence of clinical DVT is reported in 9.8 % and PE in 2.6 % of patients during the phase of acute rehabilitation following SCI. 25 Although the risk of pulmonary emboli is highest between the 2nd and 4th week of injury, the risk of DVT drops approximately 20 days after the initial SCI 26 . Although the incidence of clinically significant thromboembolism appears to be relatively small, effective prophylactic measures need to be utilised, given the potentially devastating consequences. Pathophysiology and Risk Factors: The blood vessel wall may be injured by extrinsic pressure on the paralysed extremity in the neurologically impaired patient. Altered blood flow results in venous stasis that predisposes the individual to the development of a thrombus. Alterations in blood constituents also result in alterations in haemostasis and a hypercoagulable state seen in patients with SCI. A higher incidence of DVT is seen with motor complete injuries, paraplegics and in males. Clinical Presentation and Investigations: Limb swelling, warmth and discolouration are usually associated with DVT. Pain in the calf is unlikely to be a feature. In a patient with a clinical suspicion for DVT, initial evaluation is carried out with venous ultrasound if the results are equivocal or negative. If clinical suspicion is high, venography should be performed. Presenting symptoms in PE are dyspnoea, tachypnoea, tachycardia, fever, or chest pain; these are also symptoms found with pneumonia or atelectasis. Less commonly, PE may present as syncope, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia. It is important to have a high index of suspicion for DVT and PE because of the potentially fatal consequences. Treatment and Management of Thromboembolism: The standard treatment for established venous thromboembolism has been anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin, given by constant intravenous infusion, followed immediately by oral warfarin for a specified number of months. Standard anticoagulation will not prevent embolization of an existing thrombus or induce dissolution of the thrombus. Recently, an increasing number of Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH) have become available and have been studied as an initial treatment for acute thromboembolism. After initiation of treatment with LMWH, oral anticoagulation with warfarin follows and should be continued long term. The purpose of long term anticoagulant therapy is to prevent recurrent DVT. Warfarin is administered at an initial dosage of 5 to 10 mg/day for the first 2 days. The daily dose is then adjusted according to the International Normalised Ratio (INR). The INR has become the accepted standardisation of the Prothrombin Time (PT) for monitoring oral anticoagulant therapy. Heparin therapy is discontinued on the fourth or fifth day following initiation of warfarin therapy, provided the INR is in the recommended therapeutic range of 2 to 3. Frequent INR determinations are often required early on to establish the therapeutic dose of warfarin. The optimal duration of treatment should be at least 6 months. Prevention of Thromboembolism: Considering the significant risk, morbidity, and mortality of thromboembolism in the SCI population, it is clear that methods to prevent the development of this medical complication should be strongly considered and implemented. Non-pharmacological Modalities: Passive Range of Motion (ROM) exercises should be initiated by > physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and nurses at the acute > stage of SCI Graduated elastic or compression stockings Pneumatic compression sleeves Placement of vena cava filters is frequently performed in certain > high-risk patient populations to prevent the development of PE; > however, one should remember that the presence of a filter itself > does not prevent the development of venous thrombosis. Warfarin: As a means of prophylaxis, the use of warfarin has the advantage of being orally effective. However, it has the disadvantage of requiring close monitoring of INR, and the increased risk of bleeding and its associated complications. Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH): The benefits and increased effectiveness of LMWH for the prevention of thromboembolism in a variety of patient populations has been increasingly studied in recent years and it has been suggested and recommended as one of the more effective forms of DVT prophylaxis in patients with acute SCI. Duration of preventive management: Although generally the recommended treatment is for 6 months, the duration of prophylaxis should be individualised, depending on the risk factors, medical condition, functional status, and care and support services of the SCI individual.17 Endocrine Function \u00b6 The endocrine system is affected in SCI patients, primarily due to unpredictable, sympathetic nervous system dysfunction and the effects of inactivity. SCI has an impact on the endocrine system in several ways. The diagnosis and treatment of common endocrine disorders presents unique challenges in this patient population. The Spectrum of Endocrine Abnormalities after SCI SCI patients are predisposed to chest and other infections, resulting in increased antidiuretic hormone levels and hyponatremia. The physical inactivity associated with SCI has a profound effect on metabolic function. Decreased energy expenditure causes an increase in adiposity. Muscle atrophy occurs below the level of the cord lesion. Insulin resistance which occurs can result in diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. As a chronic disease process, longstanding SCI can produce a variety of nonspecific effects on endocrine function. Chronic pyelonephritis may cause renal failure which results in phosphate retention, hypocalcaemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Pituitary disorders Impaired growth hormone secretion, due to stress, such as that > caused by injury or illness, results in reduced growth and muscle > mass Suppressed gonadotropins result in low testosterone and oestrogen > levels SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic > hormone) Central diabetes insipidus Associated head trauma presents with polyuria, low specific > gravity urine and hypothyroidism from pituitary gland injury Adrenocortical hormones Without cortisol, SCI patients with infection and myocardial > infarction are susceptible to irreversible shock. Following SCI, levels of renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone > hormones may be elevated. Secondary adrenal hormonal insufficiency is seen with associated > head trauma. Reproductive Function: Semen analysis in SCI patients shows a decreased number and motility of sperm and abnormal morphology. Female sexual function is less affected. Lipid disorders: Multiple forms of lipid disorders may be seen in SCI individuals as they are closely associated with diabetes mellitus. Hypertriglyceridaemia, low HDL, and atherosclerosis are commonly seen sequelae. Glucose Metabolism in SCI: Glucose intolerance is more common in SCI individuals when compared with the general population. The level and completeness of SCI correlates with the degree of impairment of glucose intolerance. The higher the level and the more complete the SCI the greater the glucose intolerance. Myocardial ischemia may be silent because of the destruction of the sensory pathways hence the treating team during the rehabilitation stage should be cautious and aware of this. In the acute stage following SCI, strict control of glucose is recommended and insulin may be required. Weight loss and increased physical activity are suggested. Reviews by an ophthalmologist, podiatrist and endocrinologist are also required. SCI patients can be at risk of both fasting and postprandial forms of hypoglycaemia. Fasting hypoglycaemia is caused by a lack of glucose production during gluconeogenesis, and can be seen in the increased uptake of glucose into insulin-sensitive tissues. In a tetraplegic person the usual signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia do not occur. There is an atypical presentation with symptoms of impaired glucose delivery to the brain, such as drowsiness and impaired mentation. Mild hypoglycaemia can be treated with oral glucose solutions or juice. In more severe hypoglycaemia or in situations where oral administration of glucose is not possible, parenteral therapy should be given. Tetraplegic patients require assistance in the treatment of hypoglycaemia. Calcium Disorders SCI patients are at increased risk of renal failure and nephrotic syndrome. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by renal failure, low calcium intake, or reduced exposure to sunlight as seen in some SCI individuals. Impaired renal function results in phosphate retention; this decreases the production of the active form of vitamin D by the kidneys. Secondary hyperparathyroidism results in the worsening of osteoporosis, which further decreases the bone density of SCI patients. This increases the risk of fracture. Patients with low serum albumin, as seen in some SCI individuals, are further predisposed to decreased serum calcium. Hypocalcaemia presents with physical findings of muscular irritability such as tetany, but these can be difficult to elicit in SCI patients. Hypocalcaemia is usually treated with the infusion of intravenous calcium. Hypercalcaemia is associated with immobilisation and other causes. Clinical features include nausea and vomiting, mental confusion, frequent urination, thirst and pyrexia. The treatment is hydration with normal saline to encourage calcium excretion by kidneys. Pamidronate (biphosphonate) may be used in adults for the treatment of hypercalcaemia associated with immobilisation. Fractures of Long Bones \u00b6 The potential for increased numbers of pathological fractures in SCI patients exists because of increased life span and activity. Fracture management in SCI patients can be divided into: \u2022 Group 1: Fracture sustained in the same accident as the spinal cord injury \u2022 Group 2: Fracture occurred in osteoporotic bone of patients with chronic SCI \u2022 Group 3: Fracture in a chronic SCI caused by high energy The treatment recommendations are: \u2022 Group 1\u2014Treat long bone fractures with either the conservative method with closed manipulative reductions and immobilisation, or with open reduction and internal fixation depending on the fracture personality \u2022 Group 2\u2014Minimal specific treatment needed. Open reduction and internal fixation is usually contraindicated in a vast majority of the cases due to increased postoperative implant-associated complications \u2022 Group 3\u2014Treatment by methods that are least likely to disrupt the patient\u2019s ADL. Fractures in acute SCI: Concomitant long bone fractures are not uncommon with SCI. The fracture occurrence varies by gender, race, injury level, and aetiology of injury. The knowledge of these associated factors will aid in early recognition of fractures, preventing complications, and facilitating rapid mobilisation and rehabilitation outcomes of patients with SCI. Silver and colleagues found that 27 out of 100 acute SCI patients had concurrent fractures, with most of them involving ribs, sternum, and clavicle. 27 In a series of 508 individuals with spine trauma (with or without neural deficit), Saboe et al described associated injuries by anatomic site and its content, including, but not limited to, fractures. Of these patients, 240 were reported to have associated injuries, most commonly involving head (26%), chest (24%), and long bone (23%). 28 Wang and colleagues reported an incidence of 28% of patients with SCI having associated extra spinal fractures. Of these patients 37% had more than one fracture site. 29 The most common region of fractures was chest, followed by lower extremity, upper extremity, head and others. The overall incidence rate was higher for women than men, for whites than non-whites, for paraplegics than tetraplegics, and for those injured in motor vehicle crashes than others. Compared with patients having a single fracture, those who had multiple fractures were likely to be white, paraplegic, and injured in motor vehicle crashes. There was no age difference in the incidence of concurrent fractures, single or multiple. Fracture treatment should aim towards a union, maintenance of length, prevention of angular deformity, and maximisation of functional return. Because high-energy accidents often cause multiple injuries, emergency stabilisation of organ systems is vital prior to treatment of the extremity fractures. Femur fractures are the most common long bone injury, followed by tibia, humerus, radius, and ulna fractures. Lower extremity fractures have improved outcome with operative stabilisation irrespective of the neurological status. Early operative treatment is preferred for these fractures unless closed treatment can be carried out with a functional orthosis, allowing adequate healing without delaying participation of the patient in the process of rehabilitation. Non-operative treatment is considered for complete injuries with non-functional extremities. Inadequate non-operative treatment can delay healing and lead to shortening and angular deformities. Upper extremity fracture management is based on general orthopaedic principles, with a tendency towards open reduction and internal fixation. It must be appreciated that the upper limbs of a SCI patient will have dual functionality substituting some of the lower limb functions requiring sound healing of these fractures. Complications: Pressure sores from splints, casts and external fixation devices Splinting in the wrong position may lead to fixed deformity Delayed union, mal-union and non-union Ankle fractures usually exhibit low-energy fracture patterns. They can be treated with a padded posterior splint. Healing may occur by either bony or fibrous union without complications. Angular deformities are unacceptable because pressure sores can develop, commonly overlying malleoli. Metatarsal base and toe fractures in the foot are usually undisplaced and unite without serious complications using a soft splint. Heterotopic Ossification \u00b6 Heterotopic Ossification (HO) is a pathological condition with true soft tissue bone formation at the ectopic sites around the bone and joints that is morphologically similar to normal skeletal bone. Reported incidence varies greatly in the SCI population, ranging from 10\u201353%30. The hip is the most common site (70\u201397%) for HO in SCI patients followed by knee, shoulder and elbow. HO usually develops at 1 to 4 months following acute SCI. In patients with SCI with clinically significant HO, 20\u201330% present with a reduction in joint range of motion whereas 3 \u2013 8% can develop complete ankylosis with loss of movement30. Maturation of HO usually takes from 1 to 2 years. The risk factors include complete SCI, spasticity, pressure ulcer and trauma. Forcible stretching of the range of movement (ROM) can cause haemorrhage and new HO. Generally, HO is self-limiting and rarely requires surgery. Neurogenic HO is also seen following associated traumatic brain injuries. The severity of the injury on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) usually correlates with the extent of the ossification measured in square centimetres. 31 The clinical features are localised soft tissue swelling and decreased ROM. HO can also present as low grade fever, joint effusion, pain with ROM of the affected joint and limb swelling. In the acute phase the presentation of HO around the hip can mimic an abscess. An early diagnosis at a time of clinical uncertainty, before the plain radiographic features develop, has distinct advantages and therapeutic implications. The unique pathological evolution and maturation of the lesion is clearly demonstrated by sequential ultrasound scan assessments with depiction of the 'zone phenomena' seen on histological examination. Sonographic scans of spinal injury patients proved diagnostic, before radiographic evidence of heterotopic bone formation on plain X-rays, and confidently excluded HO in patients without any false negative results. 32 Radiological diagnosis can be confirmed in the acute stages with triple phase bone scan, and is considered as the gold standard investigation in these stages. Plain x-rays will only show when there is established calcification. Bone scans will become negative after both 6 months of onset and when the HO is mature. Serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated from 2 weeks with a peak at up to 10 weeks. After this period it will become normal. Medical treatment with etidronate sodium (bisphosphonate) or indomethacin are typically effective before the formation of the mature HO. Low dose radiation therapy can be useful in controlling HO and preventing recurrence following surgical removal. Excessive force and trauma to maintain ROM of the affected joint should be avoided in the acute phase. Gentle passive ROM is important in maintaining joint function. Once HO is identified, the ROM exercises should be withheld until the inflammatory signs have subsided. Active-assistive range of motion exercises should then be prescribed, and gentle passive range of motion exercises should be initiated for completely paralysed joints. Surgical resection of the established mature HO from bone scan and normal alkaline phosphatase is only indicated to promote easier positioning, transfers, wheelchair seating and ADL. The surgery can be associated with infection, neurovascular injury, incomplete removal and recurrence. There is a high risk of local recurrence of HO following surgical excision. Pressure Ulcers and Wound Care \u00b6 Despite current interest and advances in medicine, surgery, nursing care, and self-care education, pressure ulcers, a well-known preventable condition, still remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This is more the case for patients with impaired sensation, prolonged immobility, or advanced age. The incidence of pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury is reported in the range of 25-66 %.33, 34 The European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) and American National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) provide the following pressure ulcer definition: \u201cA pressure ulcer is localised injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear\u201d. The pressure ulcers develop from progressive tissue ischemia as well as from the reperfusion injury. The elevated tissue pressure prevents capillary reperfusion leading to tissue death and necrosis. The severity depends primarily on the degree and duration of the pressure exerted and the location. The common sites of involvement include the skin over the ischeal tuberosities (28%), the sacrum (17-27%), the trochanter (12-19%), and the heel (9-18%). Pressure ulcers commonly develop on the occiput and the scapula of patients who were made to spend extended amounts of time lying supine. The scapular regions are particularly vulnerable in patients with cervical or upper thoracic cord lesions and sensory impairment, being treated in a halo vest or body jacket. Patients with the secondary manifestations of osteoporosis and associated thoracic kyphosis can develop pressure ulcers over the spinous processes. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes mellitus are more often prone to develop pressure ulcers in the heels. The life time risk of pressure ulcer in an SCI person is reported to be up to 80 %. High level lesions and darker skin are associated with increased incidence. Regular and frequent whole body assessment for skin integrity with emphasis on \u201cat risk areas\u201d is an important aspect of pressure ulcer care. The emphasis in the acute stage should be on a strict and regular \u201cmanual\u201d turning and positioning regime to prevent pressure on the skin over any bony prominence for more than 3-4 hours if the patient is on a pressure relieving mattress. More frequent turning (every 1-2 hours) is required if the patient is on an ordinary mattress. On a relatively hard surface pressure sores can develop within less than an hour, and much less than an hour in the stage of spinal shock. The risk factors are impaired sensation, impaired mobility, hypo-nutrition, vascular disease, diabetes, altered mental status, incontinence, poor hygiene, shear and friction forces, old age, repeated hospitalisation and institutionalisation without recognised and adequate pressure-relief measures. Pressure sores are completely preventable complications that attract successful litigation once developed. International Pressure Ulcer Classification: EPUAP and NPUAP have agreed upon four levels of injury 35 , recognising that the terms unclassified / unstageable and deep tissue injury are generally graded as \u201cIV\u201d in Europe. Standardised measures of ulcer location, diameter, depth, stage, colour, and drainage are necessary to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the wound. This information is also essential to monitor healing, to plan efficient wound treatment, and to document progress. Photographs, which include a measuring tape close to the ulcer, and diagrams, are currently useful additional tools for monitoring the rate of healing of pressure ulcers. Bone scans, CT and MRI scans may be necessary to assess the extent of involvement of underlying structures. Angiography and Doppler ultrasound to assess the perfusion status may also be necessary in some cases. Treatment: Prevention and minimisation of the risk factors, by identification and pressure relieving, are the corner stone of treatment. Proper positioning, pressure relief practice and hygiene are crucial for pressure ulcer prevention and healing. Pressure mapping and wheelchair and cushion review may be necessary in identifying \u201cat risk\u201d patients. Conditions contributing to the development of pressure sores and/or delaying their healing should be identified and treated. Once developed, complete pressure relief from the ulcer until the ulcer is completely healed is essential. The patient will require regular manual positional changes every 2 hours and the use of pressure relieving support surfaces. This is recommended in order to prevent the development of new pressure sores elsewhere. Nutritional assessment is vital. A high protein level with zinc supplement to correct hypoalbuminaemia may be required, or a low zinc level and indeed blood transfusions may be indicated to correct anaemia associated with hypoproteinaemia. All ulcers are likely to be colonised not necessarily infected, thus monitoring with wound swabs for culture and sensitivity should be considered. Antibiotic therapy is rarely required unless the patient develops cellulitis, osteomyelitis, pyrexia or the wound grows beta haemolytic streptococci. Topical antibiotics are rarely used and inadvisable. Debridement of necrotic tissue is essential for optimal wound healing. Cellulitis or osteomyelitis requires IV antibiotic therapy. A surgical consultation is likely to be required if osteomyelitis develops. Collagenase and alginate dressings promote autolytic debridement. These are contraindicated in the presence of an active infection. Gauze dressing promotes mechanical debridement. Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) therapy provides excellent results for deep and heavily draining pressure ulcers. Surgical debridement may be performed at the bedside or in the theatre depending on the likelihood of bleeding, the size of the wound, the level of injury, the presence or absence of sensation, and the general condition of the SCI patient. Enzymatic debridement is much slower. Enzymatic debridement however leaves granulation tissue unharmed to promote healing. Primary excision and direct closure is possible for the majority of small sores and for large sores that reduce in size with conservative treatment. Closure of these sores can be achieved without significant soft tissue loss or tension at the closure site. Primary excision and direct closure have the advantage of not disturbing the anatomy of the vascular supply to the skin or reducing the vascular supply within an area of skin that would otherwise be surrounded by fibrous tissue when a skin flap is fashioned. Myocutaneous flap repair may be indicated for carefully selected elderly patients following failed conservative measures and with advanced large stage 3 or 4 pressure sores. The flap repairs carry high recurrence rate. Pressure ulcers developing in a flap may not heal despite all efforts; hence one should consider this as a last resort as the future options for healing will be none. The nutritional status must be optimised and focal spasticity should be corrected before contemplating surgery to reduce wound dehiscence and recurrence. The postoperative care is at least as important as the surgery itself to minimise tension and shearing close to the surgical site. Investigation of why and how the sore developed, rigorous pressure relief protocols, adequate assessment, and improvement of techniques of transfer from and into the wheelchair must be in place before and after the surgery. Psychological Aspects \u00b6 In the acute stage of SCI, an individual may experience a range of emotions such as numbness, despair, fear, resentment, denial, hope, and anger. This emotional turmoil is often chaotic and disorganised. It may be further complicated by the enforced state of sensory deprivation. Anxiety and depression may become apparent in approximately one third of individuals. The frustrations associated with the physical limitations of such a severe injury are compounded by the fact that most patients are young. Prior to the injury the majority of the patients lived active lives, often expressing themselves through physical activities. Elderly patients find equal difficulty in adjusting following a life of physical and mental independence. The sudden realisation that one is no longer able to continue living in the manner one was accustomed to and that one needs to lead a more ordered, physically and mentally demanding life can result in difficult and prolonged periods of adjustment. Failure to recognise that this process can continue for as long as two or three years may negatively influence the process of rehabilitation and the patient\u2019s coping strategies and ability to readjust. The patient needs time to come to terms with a new status and to make decisions about the future without undue pressure. Detection of these psychological problems is vital in order to tailor the management process to the individual patient. Peer support and advice from well-adjusted individuals with a similar level and density of spinal cord lesion, similar educational and/or vocational background, and with a few years of experience of life with a spinal cord injury is in our experience essential in managing SCI patients. We believe this to be the most effective psychological support a newly injured patient can benefit from. This supervised peer support not only inspires hope, by demonstrating that there is light at the end of the tunnel, but it also motivates and helps the process of physical, mental, psychological and emotional readjustment as well as social reintegration. It invariably helps with either social, recreational, or vocational reintegration, employment or a combination of many or all of these. 10 Other problems that may be present include: pre-injury behavioural, psychological or mental health problems, cognitive malfunction associated with concomitant head injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, in which an individual continually relives their accident, prolonged periods of depression, anxiety, aggression, or lack of cooperation with the treatment and rehabilitation. The role of the psychologist cannot be underestimated for this relatively small group of patients. Detection of these problems and the provision of psychological therapy will enable the majority of individuals to overcome them, and to reduce the difficulties in the process of rehabilitation. The partner and family members invariably experience psychological difficulties and equally benefit from support and intervention. A holistic approach, including a psychological perspective, will not only benefit the patient and the family by enhancing the rehabilitation process, but will also help the patient to regain dignity, readjust, reintegrate into the community and society in general, and compete for and regain employment. 10 Management of the Upper Limbs and Hands in the Early Stages Following Injury Upper limb orthosis are used to protect, support, and improve the function of the arm, forearm and hand. They play an important role to maximise the use of the upper limbs in the tetraplegic individuals. Fortunately today, the trained therapists involved with the tetraplegic patients in the early days following injury are aware of the need for protective splinting to avoid development of contractures of the upper limb joints. Early measurement, fabrication, and fitting of a functional orthosis will facilitate the process of rehabilitation. The grip patterns, measured using a standard dynamometer, are useful to evaluate the progress. Upper Limb Orthosis are Used in Tetraplegic Individuals for the Following Reasons To support the wrist and hand in a functional position. To support a flail wrist and/or hand joints To prevent overstretching of the finger flexor muscles To strengthen weak muscles To correct deformity, such as a claw hand To prevent joint contractures, such as an elbow flexion contracture To facilitate function Orthosis can be divided into two main categories: static orthosis for position, and dynamic orthosis for function. Static wrist and hand orthosis are used to help prevent deformity and are designed to maintain thumb opposition, thumb web space and palmar arch, as well as proper angulation between the hand and forearm. This is especially important in the first month following injury, when motor power return is greatest. Dynamic orthosis, such as the wrist-driven wrist-hand orthosis, provide prehension to increase independence in activities of daily living. In practice, externally powered systems are difficult to maintain. Current designs utilise simple, lightweight mechanical components which are lighter and more easily maintained. Assessment of the function of the hand, whether the tenodesis action is functional and/or whether it could be enhanced through splinting, is essential to help the therapist and the patient choose the optimal orthosis for enhancing function. Initially, the patient with high cervical (C1 to C4) injury is fitted with a prefabricated, soft, resting hand splint. In cases where a more permanent hand orthosis is needed, the static wrist-hand orthosis can be used. The orthosis helps to reduce the risk of contracture and deformity. This is accomplished by supporting the wrist in a functional position, with the hand and wrist in approximately 20 to 30 degrees of extension and holding the thumb in a position of abduction. The orthosis is contoured into the palmar arch of the hand to maintain its shape. This allows a position appropriate for many functional activities in the event of later motor return. In individuals with C4/C5 level injuries, to prevent hand deformity the patient must wear a static orthosis at night. To prevent elbow range of motion restrictions, an elbow extension orthosis, which keeps the elbow in extension against an unopposed biceps, may be worn at night. Some static orthosis also incorporate a means of attaching tools to allow for increased function. In individuals with C5 level injuries, the wrist is positioned in a static orthosis in a functional position to maximise the potential for future function due to progressive recovery in the muscles. A position of natural finger flexion facilitates the development of flexor tendon tightness on which tenodesis function relies. The orthotic management is similar for C6/7 level injuries. At the C6 level, the patient will have intact wrist extensors along with the serratus anterior and clavicular pectoral muscles. Intact wrist extensors allow tenodesis action at the wrist to accomplish dynamic prehension for feeding, hygiene and similar activities. Individuals with C8 level injuries have intact finger extrinsic muscles, but have weak or absent intrinsic muscles. The activity of the long flexors in the absence of lumbricals creates a claw hand deformity. Prehension without initial metacarpophalangeal joint flexion becomes less effective. A static hand orthosis with a MP extension stop, such as a lumbrical bar, helps to substitute for the intrinsic minus hand. An additional thumb post orthosis maintains the web space and thumb in the opposition position. Respiratory Care in Acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury \u00b6 Respiratory dysfunction is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in SCI. The level and completeness of injury are the main determinants of the extent of respiratory dysfunction. Other concomitant injuries and comorbidities not incorporated here will have further detrimental impacts. It is essential to ensure full aeration of the lungs with proactive chest clearance of secretions regimens and monitoring to prevent secondary hypoxic damage to the spinal cord. The Minimum Basic Strategies with Complete Lesions Should Include the Following to Ensure Large Volume Ventilation of the Lungs Avoid unnecessary intubation for ventilation. Avoid early verticalisation or mobilisation of the patient before recovery from spinal shock. Maintain the supine lying position for maximal spontaneous tidal volume exchange, irrespective of the patient breathing spontaneously or being intubated and ventilated. This should continue throughout the weaning process. Use an abdominal binder when the patient is upright and until the patient recovers completely from spinal shock. Seek guidance and support from the specialised spinal cord injury centre as soon as cord damage is suspected or diagnosed. Respiratory insufficiency, common after Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) but especially in cervical cord injuries, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The more rostral and complete the damage to the spinal cord, the greater the likelihood of major respiratory impairment. Around 40% of spinal cord injuries occur in the cervical spine, a trend that is steadily increasing, with respiratory causes being responsible for death in over 20% of individuals. 41 Loss of lung volumes and relative hypoxaemia contribute to global hypoxaemia, exacerbating cord ischaemia in the acute period. 36 37 38 39 40 Respiratory compromise results in the loss of muscle strength generation capacity and reduced lung volumes, and in particular vital capacity 42 of up to 70% 38 39 , ineffective cough and secretion clearance abilities 42 43 , reductions in both lung and chest wall compliance; and an additional oxygen cost of breathing due to changes in respiratory mechanics, with obstructive sleep apnoea evident in over 50% of acute tetraplegics. 44 While some countries have specialist spinal units to manage such catastrophic trauma with a demonstrable improvement in health outcomes attributed to their contribution 45 , many individuals are initially admitted to local hospitals where healthcare professionals are less likely to fully appreciate the significant and continued vulnerabilities of such individuals. This section is aimed at providing a basic understanding of the causes and identification of the main principles of the respiratory management strategies required to maintain pulmonary health for cervical SCI patients during the initial and early post-trauma phase. Respiratory Mechanics Complete injuries above the midthoracic region will result in loss of the major respiratory muscle groups for both inspiration and expiration and thus an inability to either fully aerate the lungs or to clear pulmonary secretions, resulting in major vulnerabilities toward pulmonary collapse and infection. Intercostals and abdominal muscle paralysis result in paradoxical chest wall motion i.e. the thorax is pulled in while the hypercompliant abdomen moves out, with loss of diaphragmatic excursion through the zone of apposition. 46 The upright sitting posture results in lower lung volumes than supine lying 46 47 48 since the diaphragm loses its ability to generate the same force of contraction. Thus while somewhat counterintuitive to the respiratory clinician, the supine position should be adopted in times of respiratory compromise/distress and throughout the process of weaning from mechanical ventilation in complete cord lesions. The use of abdominal binders, applied over the lower ribs and abdomen, is common practise in the specialist centres for use in the upright position 13 , improving the VC by as much as 0.32 litres. 49 This application may, in borderline cases, offset the need for respiratory support. Assessment and Management Strategies Atelectasis and pneumonia pose a significant morbidity risk and are reported in 40-70% of cases. Respiratory assessment should be vigilant, simple and repeated frequently at the bedside to warn of impending or frank respiratory failure. As a minimum, the Vital Capacity (VC), Respiratory Rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) should all be monitored regularly, and their trends considered, preferably with arterial blood gases (ABGs) performed at frequent intervals during the first few weeks post injury. Pulse oximetry alone may be falsely reassuring in cases of slow and silent respiratory muscle pump failure, so consideration of the respiratory component of the acid base status requires arterial sampling. The motor function of the respiratory muscle is not specifically considered in the formal neurological assessments. However, since the diaphragm is innervated at C3, 4, and 5, upper limb assessment may be indicative of diaphragmatic presence or loss of function. The initial reduction of VC in the acute phase will increase steadily within the first five weeks post injury. 36 While a reduction in VC to 10ml/kg body weight is accepted, further reductions due to loss of compliance or increased resistance (e.g. atelectasis and/or infection), will cause rapid deterioration while a peak cough flow rate (which reduces with lower VCs) of at least 160l/s is essential to shear mucus along the airway walls, for airway clearance. 50 The provision of assisted cough to increase the mucus clearance ability 51 , either manually or mechanically 52 , is vital in reducing the risk of pulmonary complications and subsequent respiratory failure. A VC\\<1 litre may be inadequate to sustain spontaneous breathing and is a major indicator to provide ventilatory support. Prompt support with Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) may enable the avoidance of invasive tracheal intubation in acute SCI. 53 However, halo fixation may pose particular difficulties with mask fitting for NIV therapy. Other risks associated with NIV in a nonspecialised spinal unit include the ASCI patient being susceptible to profound and rapid desaturation, silent fall into respiratory failure, paralytic ileus, risk of air swallowing and an increased risk of acute vomiting and aspiration. The loss of arm and hand function must not be forgotten when selecting the NIV interface. Neurological deficits may be asymmetrical so the all-important diaphragm should be considered as two separate halves. Paralysis of a single hemidiaphragm in a complete cervical spine injury, which may go unnoticed by the untrained eye, may require longer term or at least part-time respiratory support, since all intercostal and abdominal muscle activity will be lost (Recently, a crossed phrenic nerve pathway has been identified, thought to be able to support the contralateral diaphragm, though the clinical implications of this have not yet been fully explored). 54 Where diaphragm function is uncertain, more detailed assessment using the useful tools of fluoroscopic screening, M mode ultrasound 56 , and surface EMG should be carried out. 55 Aspiration poses a significant risk to the tetraplegic patient. Kirshblum et al 57 studied 187 acute SCI patients. Of these, 42 had signs of aspiration with video fluoroscopic confirmation in 31cases. Kirshblum\u2019s independent predictors of dysphagia by VFSS were tracheostomy tube at the time of admission, recent cervical spine surgery particularly with an anterior approach, and age. Clinically, aspiration often goes unnoticed but may present as repeated respiratory infections or repeated/persistent lobar collapses. Assessment of swallowing, with speech and language therapist input, is vital as salivary and/or food aspiration can have a major detrimental impact upon respiratory health and complicate the ongoing management. Medications should be reviewed due to the effects of some on muscle fibres e.g. corticosteroids and lipid-lowering agents. The profound psychological impact of denying oral intake in the longer term, in a high SCI individual, should not be overlooked. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation and Weaning The likelihood of a tracheostomy requirement for ventilation post-surgical fixation 58 is increasingly common outside the specialist centres. When diaphragm function is lost, invasive mechanical ventilatory support is essential, though recovery has been seen to occur as late as 12 months post injury 59 . Regardless of the timing, the method of ventilation for SCIs requires larger tidal volumes 37 (at least 10-15mls/kg), to ensure effective aeration of the lung bases and avoidance of atelectasis and infection. This is well tolerated by SCI patients, with no known evidence to demonstrate pulmonary damage in the absence of acute lung injury. The effect of large volume ventilation is that of respiratory alkalosis, with no long term detrimental effect from this. 60 Electrolyte monitoring in the acute stabilisation phase is required. The discontinuation of mechanical ventilatory support is likely to take some weeks to achieve. Consistent factors underpinning successful weaning after spinal cord damage have been attributed to accurate neurological assessment; prevention of pulmonary atelectasis by physiotherapy; ventilator free breathing (VFB) graduated according to VC; rest periods with controlled ventilation; cuff deflation allowing translaryngeal air flow; and regular tracheostomy tube changes. 61 It may be useful to highlight the significant incidence of sleep apnoea (both central and obstructive in nature) in tetraplegic patients immediately post injury 44 , which increases over time 61 , as this is likely to complicate the respiratory picture and even delay weaning if unrecognised. Conclusion \u00b6 Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI) are potentially catastrophic injuries. With good simultaneous management of the injured spine, and support for the family members, the multisystem malfunction and the psychological, social, emotional, financial, vocational, environmental and economic consequences of the spinal cord injury and its effects can be minimised. A significant majority of patients with incomplete paralysis can recover walking. Patients who do not recover, can, with ongoing expert monitoring care and support, lead healthy, fulfilling, fruitful, competitive lives and participate again in society. 10 References \u00b6 Glick T.

In the USA for the past two decades it has remained unchanged at 40 per million population per year 1 . Elsewhere it usually does not exceed 20 new cases per million population per year. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 In the UK the incidence ranges from 10 to 15 per million population per year. In recent years there has been an increase in the proportion of injuries to the cervical spinal cord, with more tetraplegic patients than paraplegics being admitted to hospital. Race: There has been a trend in the incidence in various ethnic groups in the USA with an increase in Afro-Caribbean and a decrease in the White population. Currently the incidence is 63% among Caucasian, 22.7% Afro-Caribbean, 11.8% in the Hispanic population and fewer than 2% in the Asian population. 9 Sex: Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) occurs predominantly among men, the male-to-female ratio is approximately 4:1. Age: SCI incidence rates are lowest for the paediatric age group, highest for persons in their late teens and early twenties, and declines thereafter. The average age at injury is 39.5 years. About 3.5% occur in children aged below 15 years of age. There has been an increasing incidence of spinal cord injury in persons older than 60 years (11.5%). 9 Prevalence: Although the incidence reflects the number of new cases that occur each year, prevalence is defined as the number of persons with a SCI who are currently alive. In the UK it is estimated that there are 40,000 persons with SCI. The prevalence of SCI in the USA is estimated to be between 721 and 906 per million populations. The Stockholm study reported a prevalence rate of 227 per million. Causes of spinal cord injury: Overall, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI); the most common causes of SCI remain motor vehicle accidents (42%), falls (27.1%), interpersonal violence (15.3%) and sports (7.4%). Other non-traumatic causes of SCI include vascular disorders, tumours, inflammation, infection, demyelinating diseases, disc prolapse, iatrogenic injuries including spinal injections and epidural catheter placement, vertebral fractures secondary to osteoporosis, Vitamin B12 deficiency, congenital and developmental disorders.","title":"Epidemiology"},{"location":"chap2/#effects-and-special-characteristics-of-spinal-cord-injury10","text":"Traumatic spinal cord injuries are potentially catastrophic injuries. Their medical and nonmedical effects can be devastating if not adequately and simultaneously managed. SCI causes generalised physiological impairment and multisystem malfunctions that depend on the reflex activity of the spinal cord segments distal to the lesion. Changes in the level of reflex activity of the spinal cord occur throughout the patient\u2019s life with often unpredictable changes in function of the various body systems. Each system malfunction is a source of multiple disabilities and a potential source of a wide variety and range of complications. For example impairment of bladder functions can result in urinary incontinence, detrusor overactivity, urinary infections, hydronephrosis and renal failure. When a complication develops, the loss of the co-ordinating and moderating functions of the brain usually results in a cascade of intersystem effects that are rarely seen in other conditions. These are rarely easy to manage. For example, an anal fissure, while painless in these patients can nevertheless cause excess spasticity which in turn may cause a fall and fracture of a long bone. Alternatively, excess spasticity involving the pelvic floor muscles can result in urinary retention, autonomic dysreflexia with devastating symptoms and signs, and possibly cerebrovascular accident. Conventional symptoms and signs of pathology are absent because of sensory impairment or loss below the injury. This can result in delay of diagnosis usually with unpleasant consequences. Adding the number of disabilities and potential complications to the various system impairments, one can easily appreciate the magnitude of the burden to the patient, partner, carers, and the team responsible for the treatment, rehabilitation and education of the patient. Almost all complications following SCI are preventable and when developed their effects can be minimised. The nonmedical effects of SCI are equally devastating to patients and family members. The importance of planning the management programme, including frequent reassessments, re-calibration and modification of the programme, according to the level of the reflex activity of the spinal cord and the various levels of functionality of the various systems of the body throughout the patient\u2019s life cannot be overemphasised. The only difference in the requirement for monitoring between the acute stage and the long term is the frequency of the monitoring. Fortunately, the incidence of spinal cord injuries is the lowest of all major trauma injuries. A general hospital serving a population of 250,000 in the UK is likely to receive fewer than four newly injured patients per year. The competencies of clinicians and allied professionals required for adequate expert multidisciplinary management of SCI patients cannot be developed to adequately manage such complex conditions in general hospitals with such small numbers of patients. The management of SCI patients is therefore safer, more efficient and more cost-effective in Spinal Injuries Centres (SIC) equipped with the infrastructure of equipment, knowledge, skills and expertise of adequately trained multidisciplinary teams when compared to general hospitals. Furthermore, SIC, where large numbers of patients are treated, are able to provide supervised peer support, which is of incalculable value in the facilitation of the management and psychological well-being of patients with SCI.","title":"Effects and Special Characteristics of Spinal Cord Injury10"},{"location":"chap2/#classification-terminology","text":"SCI can be broadly classified as complete or incomplete. This is a pathological definition. The diagnosis of complete SCI cannot be made however until the stage of spinal cord shock resolves. It is therefore prudent, until the reflexes return, to describe the clinical presentation as complete sensory and motor loss or as incomplete loss of either or both modalities. Once the tendon reflexes return, if there is still no motor or sensory function below the injury, by definition the injury is complete. If, following the return of the reflexes, the patient has only some motor power or sensation below the level of injury, the patient is considered to be sensory incomplete. If the reflexes have returned and the patient has both some motor function and sensation below the level of injury, the patient is also considered to be incomplete.","title":"Classification Terminology"},{"location":"chap2/#the-incomplete-sci-syndromes-are-classified-clinically-as-follows","text":"Central Cord Syndrome (CCS): Central Cord Syndrome is caused by a spinal cord lesion in the centre of the cord, usually involving a cervical lesion, with greater motor weakness in the upper extremities than in the lower extremities. The falls and the motor vehicle collisions are the most common causes, followed by cervical canal stenosis with extension injury, intramedullary haematoma, mass or syrinx. CCS is the most common of the SCI syndromes. It classically affects the elderly, and C4 and C5 are the most common levels affected. Sensory loss is variable and the patient is more likely to lose pain and/or temperature sensation than joint position or vibration. Dysaesthesia (sensation of burning in the hands or arms), especially in the upper extremities is common. Sacral sensory sparing usually exists. Frankel D is the most common impairment score. Diagnosis is supported by MRI evidence of signal changes in the centre of the cervical cord. The prognosis of CCS is considered favourable for functional recovery, especially in those below the age of 50. The clinical outcomes are significantly worse in patients aged 70 years or older. 11 The lower extremities recover first and to a greater extent. Similarly distal muscle recovery is greater in the upper limbs with intrinsic muscle recovery in the hands occuring before recovery of shoulder muscles. Following the initial period of supervised bed rest, treatment involves splinting of the hands in a functional position, strengthening and Range of Motion (ROM) exercises, trunk balance, posture stabilisation, and ADL and mobility training with appropriate assistive devices. Surgery may be indicated if there are symptoms or signs of progressive neurological deficits. Brown-Sequard Syndrome (BSS): Brown-Sequard Syndrome is an incomplete lesion in the spinal cord involving a relatively greater loss of proprioception and motor function on the same side of the spinal cord damage, along with loss of pain and temperature sensation in the opposite half of the cord damage. Horner\u2019s syndrome may be present and this is due to the involvement of the sympathetic tracts. BSS is classically seen in stab injuries and bullet wounds involving hemisection of the spinal cord, and it is also seen with most other causes of the traumatic spinal cord injury. On examination there is ipsilateral weakness and sensory loss for proprioception (vibration and touch) with preservation of pain and temperature sensation. Contralateral motor power and proprioception are preserved but pain and temperature sensations are impaired. Most patients (up to 90%) will gain mobility. Recovery is common in proximal extensors followed by the distal flexors. Anterior Cord Syndrome (ACS): Anterior Cord Syndrome involves impairment of motor function and pain and/or temperature sensation, with preservation of proprioception (touch, two point discrimination and vibration sense). ACS is seen in lesions affecting the anterior two thirds of the spinal cord sparing the posterior columns. ACS can occur at any level of the spinal cord. Common causes are vascular insufficiency or obstruction to the anterior spinal artery, mechanical compression from stenosis and trauma. Risk factors include aortic or spinal surgery, hyperflexion injury, atherosclosis and thrombotic disorders. MRI, angiography and screening for hypercoagulation status usually establishes the clinical diagnosis. Treatment in addition to management of the causes is similar to other incomplete syndromes. Functional electrical stimulation and Botulinum toxin may be indicated in selected cases for functional restoration and focal spasticity respectively. Prognosis is generally considered poor and is determined by the extent of the cord damage. About 10 to 20% however recover motor functions. Conus Medullaris Syndrome (CMS): Conus Medullaris Syndrome is a sacral cord injury with or without involvement of the lumbar nerve roots. This syndrome is characterised by areflexia in the bladder, bowel, and to a lesser degree, lower limbs. Motor and sensory loss in the lower limbs is variable, being typically bilateral but may be asymmetric. It can manifest as sciatica, saddle anaesthesia, or bowel and bladder areflexia. Prognosis is generally considered poor. Individuals with complete perineal anaesthesia are less likely to recover natural bladder functions. Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES): Cauda Equina Syndrome involves injury to the lumbosacral nerve roots within the neural canal and is characterised by areflexic bowels and/or bladder, with variable motor and sensory loss in the lower limbs. This injury is usually caused by a central lumbar disc prolapse, or following lumbar epidural injections. Because this syndrome is a nerve root injury rather than a true spinal cord injury, the affected limbs are areflexic. Clean intermittent self-catheterisation and manual bowel evacuation regimes are likely to be required for the management of the neuropathic bladder and bowels. Ankle foot orthosis are useful for ankle weakness to aid ambulation.","title":"The Incomplete SCI Syndromes are Classified Clinically as Follows"},{"location":"chap2/#physical-examination","text":"The initial clinical evaluation begins with a primary survey. The primary survey focuses on life-threatening conditions. Assessment of airways, breathing, and circulation takes precedence. A spinal cord injury must be considered concurrently following any major trauma. The clinical assessment of pulmonary function in acute spinal cord injury begins with a careful history regarding respiratory symptoms and a review of underlying cardiopulmonary comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure. Evaluation also includes respiratory rate, chest wall expansion, abdominal wall movement, force of cough, chest, limbs and other associated injuries according to a detailed secondary survey. Arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry are especially useful because the bedside diagnosis of hypoxia or carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention may be difficult. The degree of respiratory dysfunction depends on pre-existing pulmonary status, the level of SCI, and any associated chest wall or lung injury. The pulmonary function may be impaired in SCI as a result of loss of ventilatory muscle function from denervation, lung injury, such as pneumothorax, haemothorax, or pulmonary contusion, and decreased central ventilatory drive that is associated with head injury or the effects of alcohol and drugs. The axial skeleton should be examined to identify and provide initial treatment of potentially unstable spinal fractures from both a mechanical and a neurological basis. The cervical spine and paraspinal tissues should be evaluated for pain, swelling, bruising, or malalignment during palpation. Logrolling the patient to systematically examine each spinous process of the entire axial skeleton from the occiput to the sacrum can help identify and localise injury. In all patients, a careful, complete and detailed neurological assessment, including motor function, sensory evaluation, deep tendon reflexes, and perineal evaluation including the deep anal sensation with per rectal examination, is critical to establish the presence or absence of SCI, the level of injury, the density of the cord damage and to classify the lesion according to a specific cord syndrome. Complete bilateral loss of sensation or motor function below a certain level indicates a complete SCI. The presence or absence of sacral sparing can be a key prognostic indicator.","title":"Physical Examination"},{"location":"chap2/#neurological-classification","text":"Clinicians have used the Frankel classification to grade the severity of neurological loss. 12 Frankel in 1969 classified the density of the neurological lesion into five categories 12 according to the presence or absence of normal neurology, and if the neurology is abnormal according to the presence or absence of motor power or sensation below the level of injury.","title":"Neurological Classification"},{"location":"chap2/#the-frankel-grading-system12","text":"1. \u2018Complete\u2019 (Frankel - A): This means that the lesion is found to be complete, both motor and sensory, below the segmental level marked. If there is an alteration of level but the lesion remains complete below the new level, then the arrow points up or down the \u2018complete\u2019 column. 2. \u2018Sensory only\u2019 (Frankel \u2013 B): This implies that there is some sensation present below the level of lesion but that the motor paralysis is complete below that level. This column does not apply when there is a slight discrepancy between the motor and sensory level but does apply to sacral sparing. 3. \u2018Motor Useless\u2019 (Frankel - C): This implies that there is some motor power present below the lesion but it is of no practical use to the patient. 4. \u2018Motor Useful\u2019 (Frankel - D): This implies that there is useful motor power below the level of the lesion. Patients in this group can move the lower limbs and many can walk, with or without aids. 5. \u2018Recovery\u2019 (Frankel - E): This implies that the patient is free of neurological symptoms, i.e. no weakness, no sensory loss, no sphincter disturbance. Abnormal reflexes may be present. The Frankel classification system is still the most widely used classification by the clinicians from all the disciplines. The advantage of the Frankel classification is that with a single letter of the alphabet, it can describe both the density of neurological damage at a particular level, the presence or absence of sparing, and the type of sparing (motor and/or sensory) below the level of the injury. Any significant effect of treatment resulting in change of neurology can be easily described by repeating the neurological assessment, and documented by using a letter of the alphabet from A to E. The Frankel classification is not however sensitive enough to elicit small changes in the neurology to move from one grade to the other, but it remains the most practical method for describing the progress of a patient or group of patients in the clinical situation.","title":"The Frankel Grading System12"},{"location":"chap2/#asia-classification","text":"In 1982, based on the Frankel classification, the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) first published standards for neurological classification of patients with spinal cord injury. 13 In 1992, The International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS, formerly IMSoP) adopted these guidelines to create true international standards. Further refinements have been adopted including assessment of autonomic functions. The American Spinal Injury Association has established pertinent definitions. The neurological level of injury is the lowest (most caudal) level with normal sensory and motor function. For example, a patient with C6 quadriplegia has, by definition, abnormal motor and sensory function in C7 and possibly C8 & T1. The ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) follows the Frankel scale but differs in several important respects. First, instead of no function below the injury level, AIS - A is defined as a person with no motor or sensory function preserved in the sacral segments S4-S5. This definition is clear and unambiguous. There could be sensory and motor functions in both the myotomes and the dermatomes of long tracts between the cervical spinal cord and S3, but the pathology would still be described as a complete AIS - A cervical lesion. Such a patient in other words would be described as incomplete Frankel B but according to the ASIA classification he/she would be described as complete AIS-A. AIS-B is essentially identical to Frankel B but adds the requirement of preserved sacral S4-S5 function. It should be noted that AIS - A and B classification depend entirely on a single observation, i.e. the preservation of motor and sensory function of S4-5. In other words, a sensory incomplete Frankel B patient will not be considered as having long tract sparing below a C5 lesion if he/she did have sensory sparing to S2 or S3 but not S4-S5. ASIA stipulated that a patient would be an AIS-C if more than half of the muscles evaluated had a grade of less than 3/5. If more than half of the muscles evaluated had a grade of more than 3, the person was assigned to AIS-D. AIS-E is spinal column injury without any detectable neurological deficit on a neurological examination. The ASIA classified incomplete spinal cord injuries into five types, Central Cord Syndrome, Brown-Sequard Syndrome, Anterior Cord Syndrome, Conus Medullaris and Cauda Equina Syndrome. *The American Spinal Injury Association recommends the use of the following (from MRC - Medical Research Council) scale for the assessment of motor strength: * 0 - No contraction or movement 1 - Minimal movement 2 - Active movement, but not against gravity 3 - Active movement against gravity 4 - Active movement against resistance 5 - Active movement against full resistance The key muscles that need to be tested to establish the neurological level are as follows: Upper limb Biceps C5 Wrist extensors C6 Triceps C7 Long finger flexors C8 Small finger abductors T1 Lower limb Hip flexors L2 Knee extensors L3 Ankle dorsiflexors L4 Extensor Hallucis L5 Ankle plantar flexors S1 The sacral roots are evaluated by documenting the following: Perineal sensation to light touch and pinprick Bulbocavernous reflex (S3 or S4) Anal wink (S5) Rectal tone and anal sensation Urine retention or incontinence Priapism It must be appreciated that neither the Frankel nor the ASIA classification specifies the response of sensory appreciation to testing with a pin. We believe it is relevant to differentiate between the patient feeling the pin as \u201cpin prick\u201d and feeling the pin as \u201cdeep touch\u201d considering that these are likely to have different prognostic values. 16, 17, 18","title":"ASIA Classification"},{"location":"chap2/#management-of-spinal-injuries","text":"The primary objectives in the management of SCI patients include minimising the neurological damage caused during the primary injury and also preventing further injury to the damaged cord secondary to hypoperfusion, ischaemia, biochemical and inflammatory changes. Active Physiological Conservative Management (APCM) 10 is based on these objectives; it is the active simultaneous, nonsurgical management, from the early hours of injury, of the injured spine, of the multisystem neurogenic effects of spinal cord injury on respiratory, cardiovascular, urinary, gastrointestinal, dermatological, sexual, and reproductive functions, and of the associated psychological effects, rehabilitation and environmental modifications. During APCM, containment of the biomechanical instability is safely maintained in recumbency for 4-6 weeks followed by bracing during mobilisation for a further six weeks. All patients with SCI are removed from the long spinal board within twenty minutes of arrival at the emergency department or as soon as possible. Patients are moved and handled in such as a way as to prevent secondary spinal cord lesions due to inappropriate mechanical forces and to prevent pressure area damage. All patients with a spinal cord injury and/or complex and multiple spinal column injuries are managed on a spinal bed within 24hrs. Spinal column alignment is maintained throughout all turns, procedures and transfer manoeuvres. All patients are closely monitored for neurological change and pressure area protection. All patients will have a regime of 2-3 hourly spinal logroll turns established as soon as is practical following admission. Patients are left in the turned position on their side for a maximum of 3 hours, or as long as the patient tolerates it, whichever is shorter. Unless contraindicated by other injuries, within the first 24hrs post injury, nursing staff can provide a twice daily range of passive exercises for the hands and feet, supported by regular repositioning to prevent equinus and upper limb and finger contractures. This should commence with placing the feet in a 90\u02da resting position, using pillows and avoiding force. The hands are positioned on small pillows. For the tetraplegic patients, shoulders are kept in the abducted position and alternate arms are raised at each turn. All spinal cord injured patients are kept nil by mouth for at least 48hrs, and commenced on Proton Pump Inhibitors as soon as possible for prevention of gastrointestinal stress ulcers. A light diet, or enteral or parenteral feeding, is introduced gradually when bowel sounds return to normal. Patients are referred to a dietician for assessment and nutritional support within 72hrs. Bowel regime is instigated on admission and this is modified according to individual response. As all acute SCI patients present with definitive neurological bladder dysfunction, the paralysed bladder is at significant risk of nosocomial infection. It is therefore of paramount importance to prevent bladder distension and catheter blockage. All patients are catheterised on admission with a size 12 \u2013 16 gauge catheter. Indwelling catheters should be maintained on free drainage and changed at least weekly. Once the patient is stable and fluid balance is within acceptable limits the indwelling catheter should be removed and patients are commenced on a 4 hourly intermittent catheterisation. To prevent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, anticoagulation therapy is appropriately established within 48hrs. All SCI patients are fitted with properly sized thigh length TED stockings. Foot pumps or compression boots can be used, but it is important to monitor the pressure effect on the neuropathic skin in an SCI individual. Physiotherapists are involved at the earliest opportunity with a view to providing an assessment of limb movements. SCI patients can present with spinal shock which can compromise their cardiovascular status and stability. The underlying pathogenesis is the loss of the baroreceptor reflex and basal sympathetic tone in high spinal cord lesions. Also the treating team should be aware of the fact that logrolling and repositioning may cause stimulation of the vagus nerve. Atropine, usually 0.3 - 0.6 mgs, may be required to treat syncope attacks associated with bradycardia when the heart rate is below 35. Intravenous fluids are administered judiciously to prevent fluid overload. The patient\u2019s core temperature is closely monitored as SCI patients may not be able to internally regulate their body temperature, depending on the level and extent of injury. In cervical injuries the neck is secured with a rigid cervical collar and sandbags are placed on each side of the head. It is important to note that cervical collars alone are ineffective in minimising motion, both flexion and extension, of the injured cervical spine. The most commonly used collars are the Philadelphia or Miami J collars, but these are not appropriate for long-term stabilisation. Cervical collars allow 30 to 65% of normal motion. Cervical spine immobilisation is best achieved with a Halo device; this only permits less than 5% of normal cervical spine motion. Many cervical spine injuries can be treated without surgery. Immobilisation in a rigid cervical orthosis for 8 to 12 weeks is usually sufficient. For a stable cervical spine injury without compression of the neural elements, a rigid cervical brace or Halo vest system for 8 to 12 weeks usually produces a stable, painless spine without any residual deformity. Facet dislocations following reduction in traction may be immobilised in a halo vest for 8 to 12 weeks. Before mobilisation, all spinal injuries, with or without neurological deficits, should be evaluated clinically for localised tenderness and radiologic with dynamic radiographs in the flexion and extension positions. The ultimate goals of APCM management are to ensure maximum neurological recovery and independence, a pain-free flexible spine, safe functioning of the various systems of the body with minimal or no inconvenience to patients, and prevention or minimisation of complications. The great majority of injuries become biomechanically stable and pain free. Unfortunately surgery has become the preferred method of management, also known as the \u201cStandard of Care\u201d, of traumatic spinal injuries. Currently, about 80% of patients with TSCI are surgically decompressed and stabilised without the rigours of adequate research methodology or demonstration of superiority of neurological and/or other outcomes over APCM. Currently, resources are relatively easily found for surgical implants and surgical procedures in both the developing and developed world. However, it is increasingly difficult to find resources for the management of the effects of the SCI and the rehabilitation of the patient in both the acute stage and in the long term. There is no evidence to suggest that surgical stabilisation enhances the speed of healing or achieves stability earlier than with APCM. Admittedly the incidence of kyphotic deformities is lower following surgical stabilisation than following APCM, however the large majority of these kyphotic deformities are painless. The discrepancy between deformity and pain has been known for some time. Painless kyphotic deformity enhances the independence of wheelchair-bound patients and is certainly preferable to a stiff, straight neck or back following surgery. There is no evidence to suggest that surgical decompression achieves better or earlier neurological recovery than APCM in humans with incomplete cord or cauda equina injury. Patients with paralysis, general physiological impairment and multisystem malfunction do not benefit from early mobilisation, which indeed may be counterproductive. Early mobilisation of patients is associated with a reduction of vital capacity and a potential drop of oxygen saturation and /or postural hypotension. Individually, or in combination, these may further impair cord functions. Early mobilisation does not result in early completion of rehabilitation nor earlier discharge of patients with SCI. Until credible evidence demonstrates superiority of outcome with one method of treatment of the injured spine over the other, patients should be encouraged to make an informed choice between the various methods of management, assuming that the patient will receive treatment in an institution that can provide equally good APCM and surgical management. Certain groups of patients are likely to benefit from surgery and should be encouraged to consider the option. Neurologically intact patients with a physiologically stable cord but unstable injured spine, the uncontrolled epileptic, the mentally-challenged, and patients who are unable to comply with bed rest, are safer following surgical stabilisation than with conservative management. Patients with biomechanical instability from pure ligamentous injuries without bony injury are at risk of developing late painful deformities and indeed may benefit from early surgery. Patients who exhibit signs of neurological deterioration with evidence of further neurological compression of neural tissues on MRI may benefit from surgical decompression.","title":"Management of Spinal Injuries"},{"location":"chap2/#prognostic-determinants-of-recovery","text":"The prognostic determinants of neurological recovery have been extensively studied over the last five decades. Frankel et al in 1969 studied 682 consecutive patients admitted within 14 days of injury. 12 He divided these patients into 5 groups from Frankel A to E according to the neurological presentation 12 . He demonstrated that with Active Physiological Conservative Management (APCM) 10 about 60% of the FB patients (i.e. presenting with complete motor paralysis of lower limbs (LL) but sensory sparing) recovered significant power in the LL to resume ambulation. Patients presenting with minimal and useless LL motor sparing (FC) did better, with 78.43% recovering ambulation. These results were subsequently confirmed. 14 15 16 Since the mid-eighties El Masri(y) and colleagues have been studying qualitatively and quantitatively the prognostic value of the different sensory modalities and motor sparing in various groups of patients admitted within 72 hours from injury and treated with APCM. 10 16 17 They found that 86% of FC patients recovered significant motor power to resume ambulation. Of those presenting in the FB group with spared spinothalamic Pin Prick (PP) sensation, 71% recovered useful motor power to ambulate. However, only 33% of patients with post column sparing recovered7. El Masri(y) and colleagues also studied the prognostic value of PP appreciation in FB patients, finding that 75% of patients who felt the pin as PP and only 20% of those who felt the \u201cpin as pressure\u201d recovered ambulation. The percentage of motor points recovery in FB patients with PP sparing was 80.2% and a similar 79.6% in FC patients. 18 Rectal sensation on rectal examination was a poor predictor of recovery and only 12.5% of patients recovered ambulation16. The outcomes of these prognostic indicators were not affected by mal-alignment, spinal canal stenosis, degree of canal encroachment, degree of cord compression, or spinal column instability. 10 14 17 18 19 20 None of the patients studied had any surgical, cellular, pharmacological, biological, chemical, immunological, hormonal or other interventions. 10 19 20 21 The APCM consisted of adequate containment of both the \u201cbiomechanical instability\u201d of the spinal column and the \u201cphysiological instability\u201d of the spinal cord. 22 The injured spine and the medical and nonmedical effects of the SCI were managed with the patient in recumbency for about 6 weeks. This facilitated the prevention of complications such as hypoxia, hypotension which can cause reduction of spinal cord perfusion, hypertension which can cause increased cord haemorrhage, hypothermia, generalised sepsis, and/or severe anaemia. To date there is no evidence that neurological recovery following traumatic SCI is limited in patients over 65 years of age compared with younger patients. Their pre-existing health and mobility may however influence both capability and quality of ambulation. Patients younger than 65 years with muscle grade of 3 or greater in the myotome L3 and S1, and light touch sensation in the dermatome L3 and S1 within 15 days of injury (all within ASIA impairment scale D), are more likely to be independent indoor walkers within a year of injury. 23 Further studies are required to assess the power of the various prognostic indicators at different times from injury and their applicability to test outcomes of interventions not only for ambulation and functional recovery but also for autonomic functions such as bladder, bowel, cardiorespiratory, vasomotor, erectile and reproductive functions. 24","title":"Prognostic Determinants of Recovery"},{"location":"chap2/#early-complications-following-sci","text":"","title":"Early Complications Following SCI"},{"location":"chap2/#deep-venous-thrombosis","text":"Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE), are common complications of SCI, and continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite preventative measures the incidence of clinical DVT is reported in 9.8 % and PE in 2.6 % of patients during the phase of acute rehabilitation following SCI. 25 Although the risk of pulmonary emboli is highest between the 2nd and 4th week of injury, the risk of DVT drops approximately 20 days after the initial SCI 26 . Although the incidence of clinically significant thromboembolism appears to be relatively small, effective prophylactic measures need to be utilised, given the potentially devastating consequences. Pathophysiology and Risk Factors: The blood vessel wall may be injured by extrinsic pressure on the paralysed extremity in the neurologically impaired patient. Altered blood flow results in venous stasis that predisposes the individual to the development of a thrombus. Alterations in blood constituents also result in alterations in haemostasis and a hypercoagulable state seen in patients with SCI. A higher incidence of DVT is seen with motor complete injuries, paraplegics and in males. Clinical Presentation and Investigations: Limb swelling, warmth and discolouration are usually associated with DVT. Pain in the calf is unlikely to be a feature. In a patient with a clinical suspicion for DVT, initial evaluation is carried out with venous ultrasound if the results are equivocal or negative. If clinical suspicion is high, venography should be performed. Presenting symptoms in PE are dyspnoea, tachypnoea, tachycardia, fever, or chest pain; these are also symptoms found with pneumonia or atelectasis. Less commonly, PE may present as syncope, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia. It is important to have a high index of suspicion for DVT and PE because of the potentially fatal consequences. Treatment and Management of Thromboembolism: The standard treatment for established venous thromboembolism has been anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin, given by constant intravenous infusion, followed immediately by oral warfarin for a specified number of months. Standard anticoagulation will not prevent embolization of an existing thrombus or induce dissolution of the thrombus. Recently, an increasing number of Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH) have become available and have been studied as an initial treatment for acute thromboembolism. After initiation of treatment with LMWH, oral anticoagulation with warfarin follows and should be continued long term. The purpose of long term anticoagulant therapy is to prevent recurrent DVT. Warfarin is administered at an initial dosage of 5 to 10 mg/day for the first 2 days. The daily dose is then adjusted according to the International Normalised Ratio (INR). The INR has become the accepted standardisation of the Prothrombin Time (PT) for monitoring oral anticoagulant therapy. Heparin therapy is discontinued on the fourth or fifth day following initiation of warfarin therapy, provided the INR is in the recommended therapeutic range of 2 to 3. Frequent INR determinations are often required early on to establish the therapeutic dose of warfarin. The optimal duration of treatment should be at least 6 months. Prevention of Thromboembolism: Considering the significant risk, morbidity, and mortality of thromboembolism in the SCI population, it is clear that methods to prevent the development of this medical complication should be strongly considered and implemented. Non-pharmacological Modalities: Passive Range of Motion (ROM) exercises should be initiated by > physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and nurses at the acute > stage of SCI Graduated elastic or compression stockings Pneumatic compression sleeves Placement of vena cava filters is frequently performed in certain > high-risk patient populations to prevent the development of PE; > however, one should remember that the presence of a filter itself > does not prevent the development of venous thrombosis. Warfarin: As a means of prophylaxis, the use of warfarin has the advantage of being orally effective. However, it has the disadvantage of requiring close monitoring of INR, and the increased risk of bleeding and its associated complications. Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH): The benefits and increased effectiveness of LMWH for the prevention of thromboembolism in a variety of patient populations has been increasingly studied in recent years and it has been suggested and recommended as one of the more effective forms of DVT prophylaxis in patients with acute SCI. Duration of preventive management: Although generally the recommended treatment is for 6 months, the duration of prophylaxis should be individualised, depending on the risk factors, medical condition, functional status, and care and support services of the SCI individual.17","title":"Deep Venous Thrombosis:"},{"location":"chap2/#endocrine-function","text":"The endocrine system is affected in SCI patients, primarily due to unpredictable, sympathetic nervous system dysfunction and the effects of inactivity. SCI has an impact on the endocrine system in several ways. The diagnosis and treatment of common endocrine disorders presents unique challenges in this patient population. The Spectrum of Endocrine Abnormalities after SCI SCI patients are predisposed to chest and other infections, resulting in increased antidiuretic hormone levels and hyponatremia. The physical inactivity associated with SCI has a profound effect on metabolic function. Decreased energy expenditure causes an increase in adiposity. Muscle atrophy occurs below the level of the cord lesion. Insulin resistance which occurs can result in diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. As a chronic disease process, longstanding SCI can produce a variety of nonspecific effects on endocrine function. Chronic pyelonephritis may cause renal failure which results in phosphate retention, hypocalcaemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Following SCI, levels of renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone > hormones may be elevated. Secondary adrenal hormonal insufficiency is seen with associated > head trauma. Reproductive Function: Semen analysis in SCI patients shows a decreased number and motility of sperm and abnormal morphology. Female sexual function is less affected. Lipid disorders: Multiple forms of lipid disorders may be seen in SCI individuals as they are closely associated with diabetes mellitus. Hypertriglyceridaemia, low HDL, and atherosclerosis are commonly seen sequelae. Glucose Metabolism in SCI: Glucose intolerance is more common in SCI individuals when compared with the general population. The level and completeness of SCI correlates with the degree of impairment of glucose intolerance. The higher the level and the more complete the SCI the greater the glucose intolerance. Myocardial ischemia may be silent because of the destruction of the sensory pathways hence the treating team during the rehabilitation stage should be cautious and aware of this. In the acute stage following SCI, strict control of glucose is recommended and insulin may be required. Weight loss and increased physical activity are suggested. Reviews by an ophthalmologist, podiatrist and endocrinologist are also required. SCI patients can be at risk of both fasting and postprandial forms of hypoglycaemia. Fasting hypoglycaemia is caused by a lack of glucose production during gluconeogenesis, and can be seen in the increased uptake of glucose into insulin-sensitive tissues. In a tetraplegic person the usual signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia do not occur. There is an atypical presentation with symptoms of impaired glucose delivery to the brain, such as drowsiness and impaired mentation. Mild hypoglycaemia can be treated with oral glucose solutions or juice. In more severe hypoglycaemia or in situations where oral administration of glucose is not possible, parenteral therapy should be given. Tetraplegic patients require assistance in the treatment of hypoglycaemia. Calcium Disorders SCI patients are at increased risk of renal failure and nephrotic syndrome. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by renal failure, low calcium intake, or reduced exposure to sunlight as seen in some SCI individuals. Impaired renal function results in phosphate retention; this decreases the production of the active form of vitamin D by the kidneys. Secondary hyperparathyroidism results in the worsening of osteoporosis, which further decreases the bone density of SCI patients. This increases the risk of fracture. Patients with low serum albumin, as seen in some SCI individuals, are further predisposed to decreased serum calcium. Hypocalcaemia presents with physical findings of muscular irritability such as tetany, but these can be difficult to elicit in SCI patients. Hypocalcaemia is usually treated with the infusion of intravenous calcium. Hypercalcaemia is associated with immobilisation and other causes. Clinical features include nausea and vomiting, mental confusion, frequent urination, thirst and pyrexia. The treatment is hydration with normal saline to encourage calcium excretion by kidneys. Pamidronate (biphosphonate) may be used in adults for the treatment of hypercalcaemia associated with immobilisation.","title":"Endocrine Function"},{"location":"chap2/#fractures-of-long-bones","text":"The potential for increased numbers of pathological fractures in SCI patients exists because of increased life span and activity. Fracture management in SCI patients can be divided into: \u2022 Group 1: Fracture sustained in the same accident as the spinal cord injury \u2022 Group 2: Fracture occurred in osteoporotic bone of patients with chronic SCI \u2022 Group 3: Fracture in a chronic SCI caused by high energy The treatment recommendations are: \u2022 Group 1\u2014Treat long bone fractures with either the conservative method with closed manipulative reductions and immobilisation, or with open reduction and internal fixation depending on the fracture personality \u2022 Group 2\u2014Minimal specific treatment needed. Open reduction and internal fixation is usually contraindicated in a vast majority of the cases due to increased postoperative implant-associated complications \u2022 Group 3\u2014Treatment by methods that are least likely to disrupt the patient\u2019s ADL. Fractures in acute SCI: Concomitant long bone fractures are not uncommon with SCI. The fracture occurrence varies by gender, race, injury level, and aetiology of injury. The knowledge of these associated factors will aid in early recognition of fractures, preventing complications, and facilitating rapid mobilisation and rehabilitation outcomes of patients with SCI. Silver and colleagues found that 27 out of 100 acute SCI patients had concurrent fractures, with most of them involving ribs, sternum, and clavicle. 27 In a series of 508 individuals with spine trauma (with or without neural deficit), Saboe et al described associated injuries by anatomic site and its content, including, but not limited to, fractures. Of these patients, 240 were reported to have associated injuries, most commonly involving head (26%), chest (24%), and long bone (23%). 28 Wang and colleagues reported an incidence of 28% of patients with SCI having associated extra spinal fractures. Of these patients 37% had more than one fracture site. 29 The most common region of fractures was chest, followed by lower extremity, upper extremity, head and others. The overall incidence rate was higher for women than men, for whites than non-whites, for paraplegics than tetraplegics, and for those injured in motor vehicle crashes than others. Compared with patients having a single fracture, those who had multiple fractures were likely to be white, paraplegic, and injured in motor vehicle crashes. There was no age difference in the incidence of concurrent fractures, single or multiple. Fracture treatment should aim towards a union, maintenance of length, prevention of angular deformity, and maximisation of functional return. Because high-energy accidents often cause multiple injuries, emergency stabilisation of organ systems is vital prior to treatment of the extremity fractures. Femur fractures are the most common long bone injury, followed by tibia, humerus, radius, and ulna fractures. Lower extremity fractures have improved outcome with operative stabilisation irrespective of the neurological status. Early operative treatment is preferred for these fractures unless closed treatment can be carried out with a functional orthosis, allowing adequate healing without delaying participation of the patient in the process of rehabilitation. Non-operative treatment is considered for complete injuries with non-functional extremities. Inadequate non-operative treatment can delay healing and lead to shortening and angular deformities. Upper extremity fracture management is based on general orthopaedic principles, with a tendency towards open reduction and internal fixation. It must be appreciated that the upper limbs of a SCI patient will have dual functionality substituting some of the lower limb functions requiring sound healing of these fractures. Complications: Pressure sores from splints, casts and external fixation devices Splinting in the wrong position may lead to fixed deformity Delayed union, mal-union and non-union Ankle fractures usually exhibit low-energy fracture patterns. They can be treated with a padded posterior splint. Healing may occur by either bony or fibrous union without complications. Angular deformities are unacceptable because pressure sores can develop, commonly overlying malleoli. Metatarsal base and toe fractures in the foot are usually undisplaced and unite without serious complications using a soft splint.","title":"Fractures of Long Bones"},{"location":"chap2/#heterotopic-ossification","text":"Heterotopic Ossification (HO) is a pathological condition with true soft tissue bone formation at the ectopic sites around the bone and joints that is morphologically similar to normal skeletal bone. Reported incidence varies greatly in the SCI population, ranging from 10\u201353%30. The hip is the most common site (70\u201397%) for HO in SCI patients followed by knee, shoulder and elbow. HO usually develops at 1 to 4 months following acute SCI. In patients with SCI with clinically significant HO, 20\u201330% present with a reduction in joint range of motion whereas 3 \u2013 8% can develop complete ankylosis with loss of movement30. Maturation of HO usually takes from 1 to 2 years. The risk factors include complete SCI, spasticity, pressure ulcer and trauma. Forcible stretching of the range of movement (ROM) can cause haemorrhage and new HO. Generally, HO is self-limiting and rarely requires surgery. Neurogenic HO is also seen following associated traumatic brain injuries. The severity of the injury on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) usually correlates with the extent of the ossification measured in square centimetres. 31 The clinical features are localised soft tissue swelling and decreased ROM. HO can also present as low grade fever, joint effusion, pain with ROM of the affected joint and limb swelling. In the acute phase the presentation of HO around the hip can mimic an abscess. An early diagnosis at a time of clinical uncertainty, before the plain radiographic features develop, has distinct advantages and therapeutic implications. The unique pathological evolution and maturation of the lesion is clearly demonstrated by sequential ultrasound scan assessments with depiction of the 'zone phenomena' seen on histological examination. Sonographic scans of spinal injury patients proved diagnostic, before radiographic evidence of heterotopic bone formation on plain X-rays, and confidently excluded HO in patients without any false negative results. 32 Radiological diagnosis can be confirmed in the acute stages with triple phase bone scan, and is considered as the gold standard investigation in these stages. Plain x-rays will only show when there is established calcification. Bone scans will become negative after both 6 months of onset and when the HO is mature. Serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated from 2 weeks with a peak at up to 10 weeks. After this period it will become normal. Medical treatment with etidronate sodium (bisphosphonate) or indomethacin are typically effective before the formation of the mature HO. Low dose radiation therapy can be useful in controlling HO and preventing recurrence following surgical removal. Excessive force and trauma to maintain ROM of the affected joint should be avoided in the acute phase. Gentle passive ROM is important in maintaining joint function. Once HO is identified, the ROM exercises should be withheld until the inflammatory signs have subsided. Active-assistive range of motion exercises should then be prescribed, and gentle passive range of motion exercises should be initiated for completely paralysed joints. Surgical resection of the established mature HO from bone scan and normal alkaline phosphatase is only indicated to promote easier positioning, transfers, wheelchair seating and ADL. The surgery can be associated with infection, neurovascular injury, incomplete removal and recurrence. There is a high risk of local recurrence of HO following surgical excision.","title":"Heterotopic Ossification"},{"location":"chap2/#pressure-ulcers-and-wound-care","text":"Despite current interest and advances in medicine, surgery, nursing care, and self-care education, pressure ulcers, a well-known preventable condition, still remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This is more the case for patients with impaired sensation, prolonged immobility, or advanced age. The incidence of pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury is reported in the range of 25-66 %.33, 34 The European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) and American National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) provide the following pressure ulcer definition: \u201cA pressure ulcer is localised injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear\u201d. The pressure ulcers develop from progressive tissue ischemia as well as from the reperfusion injury. The elevated tissue pressure prevents capillary reperfusion leading to tissue death and necrosis. The severity depends primarily on the degree and duration of the pressure exerted and the location. The common sites of involvement include the skin over the ischeal tuberosities (28%), the sacrum (17-27%), the trochanter (12-19%), and the heel (9-18%). Pressure ulcers commonly develop on the occiput and the scapula of patients who were made to spend extended amounts of time lying supine. The scapular regions are particularly vulnerable in patients with cervical or upper thoracic cord lesions and sensory impairment, being treated in a halo vest or body jacket. Patients with the secondary manifestations of osteoporosis and associated thoracic kyphosis can develop pressure ulcers over the spinous processes. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes mellitus are more often prone to develop pressure ulcers in the heels. The life time risk of pressure ulcer in an SCI person is reported to be up to 80 %. High level lesions and darker skin are associated with increased incidence. Regular and frequent whole body assessment for skin integrity with emphasis on \u201cat risk areas\u201d is an important aspect of pressure ulcer care. The emphasis in the acute stage should be on a strict and regular \u201cmanual\u201d turning and positioning regime to prevent pressure on the skin over any bony prominence for more than 3-4 hours if the patient is on a pressure relieving mattress. More frequent turning (every 1-2 hours) is required if the patient is on an ordinary mattress. On a relatively hard surface pressure sores can develop within less than an hour, and much less than an hour in the stage of spinal shock. The risk factors are impaired sensation, impaired mobility, hypo-nutrition, vascular disease, diabetes, altered mental status, incontinence, poor hygiene, shear and friction forces, old age, repeated hospitalisation and institutionalisation without recognised and adequate pressure-relief measures. Pressure sores are completely preventable complications that attract successful litigation once developed. International Pressure Ulcer Classification: EPUAP and NPUAP have agreed upon four levels of injury 35 , recognising that the terms unclassified / unstageable and deep tissue injury are generally graded as \u201cIV\u201d in Europe. Standardised measures of ulcer location, diameter, depth, stage, colour, and drainage are necessary to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the wound. This information is also essential to monitor healing, to plan efficient wound treatment, and to document progress. Photographs, which include a measuring tape close to the ulcer, and diagrams, are currently useful additional tools for monitoring the rate of healing of pressure ulcers. Bone scans, CT and MRI scans may be necessary to assess the extent of involvement of underlying structures. Angiography and Doppler ultrasound to assess the perfusion status may also be necessary in some cases. Treatment: Prevention and minimisation of the risk factors, by identification and pressure relieving, are the corner stone of treatment. Proper positioning, pressure relief practice and hygiene are crucial for pressure ulcer prevention and healing. Pressure mapping and wheelchair and cushion review may be necessary in identifying \u201cat risk\u201d patients. Conditions contributing to the development of pressure sores and/or delaying their healing should be identified and treated. Once developed, complete pressure relief from the ulcer until the ulcer is completely healed is essential. The patient will require regular manual positional changes every 2 hours and the use of pressure relieving support surfaces. This is recommended in order to prevent the development of new pressure sores elsewhere. Nutritional assessment is vital. A high protein level with zinc supplement to correct hypoalbuminaemia may be required, or a low zinc level and indeed blood transfusions may be indicated to correct anaemia associated with hypoproteinaemia. All ulcers are likely to be colonised not necessarily infected, thus monitoring with wound swabs for culture and sensitivity should be considered. Antibiotic therapy is rarely required unless the patient develops cellulitis, osteomyelitis, pyrexia or the wound grows beta haemolytic streptococci. Topical antibiotics are rarely used and inadvisable. Debridement of necrotic tissue is essential for optimal wound healing. Cellulitis or osteomyelitis requires IV antibiotic therapy. A surgical consultation is likely to be required if osteomyelitis develops. Collagenase and alginate dressings promote autolytic debridement. These are contraindicated in the presence of an active infection. Gauze dressing promotes mechanical debridement. Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) therapy provides excellent results for deep and heavily draining pressure ulcers. Surgical debridement may be performed at the bedside or in the theatre depending on the likelihood of bleeding, the size of the wound, the level of injury, the presence or absence of sensation, and the general condition of the SCI patient. Enzymatic debridement is much slower. Enzymatic debridement however leaves granulation tissue unharmed to promote healing. Primary excision and direct closure is possible for the majority of small sores and for large sores that reduce in size with conservative treatment. Closure of these sores can be achieved without significant soft tissue loss or tension at the closure site. Primary excision and direct closure have the advantage of not disturbing the anatomy of the vascular supply to the skin or reducing the vascular supply within an area of skin that would otherwise be surrounded by fibrous tissue when a skin flap is fashioned. Myocutaneous flap repair may be indicated for carefully selected elderly patients following failed conservative measures and with advanced large stage 3 or 4 pressure sores. The flap repairs carry high recurrence rate. Pressure ulcers developing in a flap may not heal despite all efforts; hence one should consider this as a last resort as the future options for healing will be none. The nutritional status must be optimised and focal spasticity should be corrected before contemplating surgery to reduce wound dehiscence and recurrence. The postoperative care is at least as important as the surgery itself to minimise tension and shearing close to the surgical site. Investigation of why and how the sore developed, rigorous pressure relief protocols, adequate assessment, and improvement of techniques of transfer from and into the wheelchair must be in place before and after the surgery.","title":"Pressure Ulcers and Wound Care"},{"location":"chap2/#psychological-aspects","text":"In the acute stage of SCI, an individual may experience a range of emotions such as numbness, despair, fear, resentment, denial, hope, and anger. This emotional turmoil is often chaotic and disorganised. It may be further complicated by the enforced state of sensory deprivation. Anxiety and depression may become apparent in approximately one third of individuals. The frustrations associated with the physical limitations of such a severe injury are compounded by the fact that most patients are young. Prior to the injury the majority of the patients lived active lives, often expressing themselves through physical activities. Elderly patients find equal difficulty in adjusting following a life of physical and mental independence. The sudden realisation that one is no longer able to continue living in the manner one was accustomed to and that one needs to lead a more ordered, physically and mentally demanding life can result in difficult and prolonged periods of adjustment. Failure to recognise that this process can continue for as long as two or three years may negatively influence the process of rehabilitation and the patient\u2019s coping strategies and ability to readjust. The patient needs time to come to terms with a new status and to make decisions about the future without undue pressure. Detection of these psychological problems is vital in order to tailor the management process to the individual patient. Peer support and advice from well-adjusted individuals with a similar level and density of spinal cord lesion, similar educational and/or vocational background, and with a few years of experience of life with a spinal cord injury is in our experience essential in managing SCI patients. We believe this to be the most effective psychological support a newly injured patient can benefit from. This supervised peer support not only inspires hope, by demonstrating that there is light at the end of the tunnel, but it also motivates and helps the process of physical, mental, psychological and emotional readjustment as well as social reintegration. It invariably helps with either social, recreational, or vocational reintegration, employment or a combination of many or all of these. 10 Other problems that may be present include: pre-injury behavioural, psychological or mental health problems, cognitive malfunction associated with concomitant head injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, in which an individual continually relives their accident, prolonged periods of depression, anxiety, aggression, or lack of cooperation with the treatment and rehabilitation. The role of the psychologist cannot be underestimated for this relatively small group of patients. Detection of these problems and the provision of psychological therapy will enable the majority of individuals to overcome them, and to reduce the difficulties in the process of rehabilitation. The partner and family members invariably experience psychological difficulties and equally benefit from support and intervention. A holistic approach, including a psychological perspective, will not only benefit the patient and the family by enhancing the rehabilitation process, but will also help the patient to regain dignity, readjust, reintegrate into the community and society in general, and compete for and regain employment. 10 Management of the Upper Limbs and Hands in the Early Stages Following Injury Upper limb orthosis are used to protect, support, and improve the function of the arm, forearm and hand. They play an important role to maximise the use of the upper limbs in the tetraplegic individuals. Fortunately today, the trained therapists involved with the tetraplegic patients in the early days following injury are aware of the need for protective splinting to avoid development of contractures of the upper limb joints. Early measurement, fabrication, and fitting of a functional orthosis will facilitate the process of rehabilitation. The grip patterns, measured using a standard dynamometer, are useful to evaluate the progress. Upper Limb Orthosis are Used in Tetraplegic Individuals for the Following Reasons To support the wrist and hand in a functional position. To support a flail wrist and/or hand joints To prevent overstretching of the finger flexor muscles To strengthen weak muscles To correct deformity, such as a claw hand To prevent joint contractures, such as an elbow flexion contracture To facilitate function Orthosis can be divided into two main categories: static orthosis for position, and dynamic orthosis for function. Static wrist and hand orthosis are used to help prevent deformity and are designed to maintain thumb opposition, thumb web space and palmar arch, as well as proper angulation between the hand and forearm. This is especially important in the first month following injury, when motor power return is greatest. Dynamic orthosis, such as the wrist-driven wrist-hand orthosis, provide prehension to increase independence in activities of daily living. In practice, externally powered systems are difficult to maintain. Current designs utilise simple, lightweight mechanical components which are lighter and more easily maintained. Assessment of the function of the hand, whether the tenodesis action is functional and/or whether it could be enhanced through splinting, is essential to help the therapist and the patient choose the optimal orthosis for enhancing function. Initially, the patient with high cervical (C1 to C4) injury is fitted with a prefabricated, soft, resting hand splint. In cases where a more permanent hand orthosis is needed, the static wrist-hand orthosis can be used. The orthosis helps to reduce the risk of contracture and deformity. This is accomplished by supporting the wrist in a functional position, with the hand and wrist in approximately 20 to 30 degrees of extension and holding the thumb in a position of abduction. The orthosis is contoured into the palmar arch of the hand to maintain its shape. This allows a position appropriate for many functional activities in the event of later motor return. In individuals with C4/C5 level injuries, to prevent hand deformity the patient must wear a static orthosis at night. To prevent elbow range of motion restrictions, an elbow extension orthosis, which keeps the elbow in extension against an unopposed biceps, may be worn at night. Some static orthosis also incorporate a means of attaching tools to allow for increased function. In individuals with C5 level injuries, the wrist is positioned in a static orthosis in a functional position to maximise the potential for future function due to progressive recovery in the muscles. A position of natural finger flexion facilitates the development of flexor tendon tightness on which tenodesis function relies. The orthotic management is similar for C6/7 level injuries. At the C6 level, the patient will have intact wrist extensors along with the serratus anterior and clavicular pectoral muscles. Intact wrist extensors allow tenodesis action at the wrist to accomplish dynamic prehension for feeding, hygiene and similar activities. Individuals with C8 level injuries have intact finger extrinsic muscles, but have weak or absent intrinsic muscles. The activity of the long flexors in the absence of lumbricals creates a claw hand deformity. Prehension without initial metacarpophalangeal joint flexion becomes less effective. A static hand orthosis with a MP extension stop, such as a lumbrical bar, helps to substitute for the intrinsic minus hand. An additional thumb post orthosis maintains the web space and thumb in the opposition position.","title":"Psychological Aspects"},{"location":"chap2/#respiratory-care-in-acute-cervical-spinal-cord-injury","text":"Respiratory dysfunction is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in SCI. The level and completeness of injury are the main determinants of the extent of respiratory dysfunction. Other concomitant injuries and comorbidities not incorporated here will have further detrimental impacts. It is essential to ensure full aeration of the lungs with proactive chest clearance of secretions regimens and monitoring to prevent secondary hypoxic damage to the spinal cord. The Minimum Basic Strategies with Complete Lesions Should Include the Following to Ensure Large Volume Ventilation of the Lungs Avoid unnecessary intubation for ventilation. Avoid early verticalisation or mobilisation of the patient before recovery from spinal shock. Maintain the supine lying position for maximal spontaneous tidal volume exchange, irrespective of the patient breathing spontaneously or being intubated and ventilated. This should continue throughout the weaning process. Use an abdominal binder when the patient is upright and until the patient recovers completely from spinal shock. Seek guidance and support from the specialised spinal cord injury centre as soon as cord damage is suspected or diagnosed. Respiratory insufficiency, common after Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) but especially in cervical cord injuries, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The more rostral and complete the damage to the spinal cord, the greater the likelihood of major respiratory impairment. Around 40% of spinal cord injuries occur in the cervical spine, a trend that is steadily increasing, with respiratory causes being responsible for death in over 20% of individuals. 41 Loss of lung volumes and relative hypoxaemia contribute to global hypoxaemia, exacerbating cord ischaemia in the acute period. 36 37 38 39 40 Respiratory compromise results in the loss of muscle strength generation capacity and reduced lung volumes, and in particular vital capacity 42 of up to 70% 38 39 , ineffective cough and secretion clearance abilities 42 43 , reductions in both lung and chest wall compliance; and an additional oxygen cost of breathing due to changes in respiratory mechanics, with obstructive sleep apnoea evident in over 50% of acute tetraplegics. 44 While some countries have specialist spinal units to manage such catastrophic trauma with a demonstrable improvement in health outcomes attributed to their contribution 45 , many individuals are initially admitted to local hospitals where healthcare professionals are less likely to fully appreciate the significant and continued vulnerabilities of such individuals. This section is aimed at providing a basic understanding of the causes and identification of the main principles of the respiratory management strategies required to maintain pulmonary health for cervical SCI patients during the initial and early post-trauma phase. Respiratory Mechanics Complete injuries above the midthoracic region will result in loss of the major respiratory muscle groups for both inspiration and expiration and thus an inability to either fully aerate the lungs or to clear pulmonary secretions, resulting in major vulnerabilities toward pulmonary collapse and infection. Intercostals and abdominal muscle paralysis result in paradoxical chest wall motion i.e. the thorax is pulled in while the hypercompliant abdomen moves out, with loss of diaphragmatic excursion through the zone of apposition. 46 The upright sitting posture results in lower lung volumes than supine lying 46 47 48 since the diaphragm loses its ability to generate the same force of contraction. Thus while somewhat counterintuitive to the respiratory clinician, the supine position should be adopted in times of respiratory compromise/distress and throughout the process of weaning from mechanical ventilation in complete cord lesions. The use of abdominal binders, applied over the lower ribs and abdomen, is common practise in the specialist centres for use in the upright position 13 , improving the VC by as much as 0.32 litres. 49 This application may, in borderline cases, offset the need for respiratory support. Assessment and Management Strategies Atelectasis and pneumonia pose a significant morbidity risk and are reported in 40-70% of cases. Respiratory assessment should be vigilant, simple and repeated frequently at the bedside to warn of impending or frank respiratory failure. As a minimum, the Vital Capacity (VC), Respiratory Rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) should all be monitored regularly, and their trends considered, preferably with arterial blood gases (ABGs) performed at frequent intervals during the first few weeks post injury. Pulse oximetry alone may be falsely reassuring in cases of slow and silent respiratory muscle pump failure, so consideration of the respiratory component of the acid base status requires arterial sampling. The motor function of the respiratory muscle is not specifically considered in the formal neurological assessments. However, since the diaphragm is innervated at C3, 4, and 5, upper limb assessment may be indicative of diaphragmatic presence or loss of function. The initial reduction of VC in the acute phase will increase steadily within the first five weeks post injury. 36 While a reduction in VC to 10ml/kg body weight is accepted, further reductions due to loss of compliance or increased resistance (e.g. atelectasis and/or infection), will cause rapid deterioration while a peak cough flow rate (which reduces with lower VCs) of at least 160l/s is essential to shear mucus along the airway walls, for airway clearance. 50 The provision of assisted cough to increase the mucus clearance ability 51 , either manually or mechanically 52 , is vital in reducing the risk of pulmonary complications and subsequent respiratory failure. A VC\\<1 litre may be inadequate to sustain spontaneous breathing and is a major indicator to provide ventilatory support. Prompt support with Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) may enable the avoidance of invasive tracheal intubation in acute SCI. 53 However, halo fixation may pose particular difficulties with mask fitting for NIV therapy. Other risks associated with NIV in a nonspecialised spinal unit include the ASCI patient being susceptible to profound and rapid desaturation, silent fall into respiratory failure, paralytic ileus, risk of air swallowing and an increased risk of acute vomiting and aspiration. The loss of arm and hand function must not be forgotten when selecting the NIV interface. Neurological deficits may be asymmetrical so the all-important diaphragm should be considered as two separate halves. Paralysis of a single hemidiaphragm in a complete cervical spine injury, which may go unnoticed by the untrained eye, may require longer term or at least part-time respiratory support, since all intercostal and abdominal muscle activity will be lost (Recently, a crossed phrenic nerve pathway has been identified, thought to be able to support the contralateral diaphragm, though the clinical implications of this have not yet been fully explored). 54 Where diaphragm function is uncertain, more detailed assessment using the useful tools of fluoroscopic screening, M mode ultrasound 56 , and surface EMG should be carried out. 55 Aspiration poses a significant risk to the tetraplegic patient. Kirshblum et al 57 studied 187 acute SCI patients. Of these, 42 had signs of aspiration with video fluoroscopic confirmation in 31cases. Kirshblum\u2019s independent predictors of dysphagia by VFSS were tracheostomy tube at the time of admission, recent cervical spine surgery particularly with an anterior approach, and age. Clinically, aspiration often goes unnoticed but may present as repeated respiratory infections or repeated/persistent lobar collapses. Assessment of swallowing, with speech and language therapist input, is vital as salivary and/or food aspiration can have a major detrimental impact upon respiratory health and complicate the ongoing management. Medications should be reviewed due to the effects of some on muscle fibres e.g. corticosteroids and lipid-lowering agents. The profound psychological impact of denying oral intake in the longer term, in a high SCI individual, should not be overlooked. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation and Weaning The likelihood of a tracheostomy requirement for ventilation post-surgical fixation 58 is increasingly common outside the specialist centres. When diaphragm function is lost, invasive mechanical ventilatory support is essential, though recovery has been seen to occur as late as 12 months post injury 59 . Regardless of the timing, the method of ventilation for SCIs requires larger tidal volumes 37 (at least 10-15mls/kg), to ensure effective aeration of the lung bases and avoidance of atelectasis and infection. This is well tolerated by SCI patients, with no known evidence to demonstrate pulmonary damage in the absence of acute lung injury. The effect of large volume ventilation is that of respiratory alkalosis, with no long term detrimental effect from this. 60 Electrolyte monitoring in the acute stabilisation phase is required. The discontinuation of mechanical ventilatory support is likely to take some weeks to achieve. Consistent factors underpinning successful weaning after spinal cord damage have been attributed to accurate neurological assessment; prevention of pulmonary atelectasis by physiotherapy; ventilator free breathing (VFB) graduated according to VC; rest periods with controlled ventilation; cuff deflation allowing translaryngeal air flow; and regular tracheostomy tube changes. 61 It may be useful to highlight the significant incidence of sleep apnoea (both central and obstructive in nature) in tetraplegic patients immediately post injury 44 , which increases over time 61 , as this is likely to complicate the respiratory picture and even delay weaning if unrecognised.","title":"Respiratory Care in Acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury"},{"location":"chap2/#conclusion","text":"Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI) are potentially catastrophic injuries.

Kohler \u201cAmputation is the beginning and not the end of a treatment\u201d 1 Amputation is a common late consequence of peripheral vascular disease or diabetes, or a result of accidental trauma, civil unrest or landmines. The actual impairment may affect many facets of life including, but not limited to, mobility, activities of daily living, body image and sexuality. Amputation is defined as the surgical, congenital or spontaneous, partial or complete removal of a limb or protecting body part covered by skin. This generally occurs in the transverse plane, but may be in the longitudinal plane if part of a limb is removed. 2 Rehabilitation of the person with an amputation of the lower limb is an excellent example of the true multidisciplinary nature of rehabilitation. There are a few areas within rehabilitation where the prevention of secondary functional loss and restoration of function can be as effective as training a person with an amputation in the use of prosthesis. Every rehabilitation service following an amputation aims to provide the patient who has lost function or ability with the highest possible level of independence (physically, psychologically, socially and economically). 3 This objective is achieved through the combined and coordinated use of medical, nursing and allied health professional skills in collaboration with the patient\u2019s personal and environmental resources. The process requires individualised assessments and treatment plans with regular review. Treatment occurs in the acute hospital, in the inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation setting, as well as in the community. Service provision should be seamless across these settings to achieve optimal functional recovery in the shortest time frame. Incidence and Prevalence \u00b6 The incidence and prevalence of amputation is difficult to determine precisely on a worldwide basis. Reasons for this include the multiple pathological aetiologies which culminate in amputation, the various definitions of clinically significant amputations, the incidence of multiple amputations being performed on the same individual and the same limb but at sequentially and progressively more proximal levels, and the underlying difficulty and deficiency of retrospective data collection in a large number of studies. 4 The major diseases that contribute to amputation include arteriovenous occlusive vascular disease, diabetes mellitus and tumours. There is considerable variation in reported amputation rates between countries. For patients with diabetes and on dialysis, the incidence rate of amputation has been reported as lowest in Japan and highest in Belgium, France and Germany 5 . In Europe the prevalence of persons with an amputation is between 17 and 30 per 100,000. 6 In industrialised countries roughly 65 \u2013 75% of amputations are as a result of underlying disease. The remainder are mostly trauma related, usually secondary to motor vehicle, industrial or farming accidents. In industrialised nations, vascular complications of diabetes are the principal cause of amputation often aggravated by the use of tobacco. In the USA, the annual incidence of non-traumatic amputation of limbs over the last decade is between 22 and 31 per 100,000. 7 Over the last decade there has been evidence of a decreasing rate of amputation for type 1 diabetes mellitus and non-diabetes-related minor amputations and a simultaneous increase in minor and major amputations for type 2 diabetes. 8 Nonindustrial countries have a higher incidence of amputation due to the higher rate of war and trauma, and less developed medical systems. In the large number of countries which have had recent or ongoing warfare or civil unrest, trauma can account for over 80% of amputations. 9 It is expected that the incidence of amputations will continue to increase in the foreseeable future in view of the increasing global incidence and prevalence of diabetes secondary to changing dietary habits, the on-going international and national disputes with continued utilisation of large numbers of land mines, and the increasing motorisation in non-industrialised nations. Prognosis \u00b6 The mortality rate of amputees is strongly influenced by the high incidence of comorbidities especially in the dysvascular amputee. Studies suggest that the mortality rate for individuals with a non-traumatic amputation of the lower limb is of the order of 40 - 50% within 2 years, and 60 - 70% within 5 years of surgery. 10 Following amputation the median time to death for patients with diabetes was 27 months compared to 47 months for patients without diabetes. 11 The rate of contralateral amputation is about 15-20% at 2 years. Patients with diabetes have a greater than tenfold increase in the incidence of new amputation compared to those without diabetes. There is a further increased risk of mortality with the relative risk of 1.54 and a mean survival of 2 years for diabetic patients who are on haemodialysis and have an amputation. In the decade up to 2005 there has been no change in prognosis following amputation but the age at amputation has increased suggesting improved pre-amputation care. 12 Higher levels of amputation are related to a shorter median time of survival. 13 For functional ability, prognosis is inversely related to increasing age and increasing number of comorbidities, and directly related to compliance with treatment. 14 The Specialised Rehabilitation Team for Persons with an Amputation \u00b6 Rehabilitation for patients following amputation is most effective with the input of a coordinated multidisciplinary team. The relative importance and input of various team members varies depending on the phase of rehabilitation. A large number of professionals and support persons will be involved in the care of a patient who requires an amputation. Figure 1 illustrates the key members of the team. Figure 1 Members of the rehabilitation team The patient\u2019s individual needs are central to all team members. A peer support program is common practice now. In such programs, patients who have adjusted to their disability following an amputation are introduced to the patient who is about to have an amputation or who has just undergone an amputation. This helps the individual to deal better with the psychosocial consequences of their amputation. Principles of Patient Assessment \u00b6 The patient should be assessed regularly throughout the various stages of the rehabilitation process. Full assessment of the patient includes a detailed assessment of the medical condition, including any comorbidities and predisposing factors to underlying vascular and peripheral vascular disease in particular, but also any other medical diseases which may interfere with the patient\u2019s activity levels and ability to mobilise. There should be an investigation into any medical or surgical conditions related to the underlying disease process such as coincidental ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease, complications related to the surgery such as delayed wound healing and wound infection, or pressure areas at other sites of the body. A detailed examination of the contralateral limb, as well as the upper limbs, is essential. A detailed examination of the limbs should be performed and recorded. This includes a muscle chart for the major muscle groups in both the upper and lower limbs, the range of movement of all the joints of the lower limbs, and also of the upper limbs (which will be essential for mobility with the use of aids), a record of the presence or absence, and quality, of pulses in the lower limbs (femoral, popliteal and pedal pulses) and the upper limbs, and any evidence of radial-femoral delay. Documentation of other markers of impaired circulation such as trophic changes of the nails and skin, changes to the hair distribution, or the presence of pregangrenous or gangrenous states is essential. The sensation of the stump and of the contralateral leg is important. Pain sensation is important for the patient to perceive any impending problems with the stump/prosthesis interface such as skin breakdown. It is particularly important to examine proprioception as the patient with the amputation relies largely on the proprioceptive impulses from the stump and the joint above the amputation for feedback regarding the position in space of the prosthesis. Proprioception in the remaining limb is relevant as the patient is more reliant on the proprioceptive feedback from the remaining foot and ankle joints to determine the stance and gait parameters. Postoperatively, a very detailed examination of the stump is essential. This includes an examination of the wound and the degree and progress of wound healing in comparison to expected progress. The circulation of the skin, in particular the circulation around the skin flap of the stump and around the suture line is assessed by determining the temperature, the presence or absence of pain, pallor, petechiae, cyanosis or poor capillary return, all of which may be indicative of stump ischemia. The circulation of the remaining limb is assessed in order to determine potential problems of the contralateral limb as well. The length and shape of the stump, the degree of oedema of the stump, tenderness of the skin flap, erythema around the suture line, presence of necrosis of the wound margin, wound dehiscence and the presence, type and amount of wound exudate and any other factors relevant to stump healing are assessed. Presence of pain, the range of movement and the strength of the musculature in the joint immediately above the amputation, and the strength of the musculature of the amputated side overall should be assessed and recorded, although at this stage detailed examination may be impeded by postsurgical pain. A detailed history and examination of the patient\u2019s activity levels and limitations of activity is required. This should include premorbid activity and activity limitations, a time frame and a rate of deterioration of activity prior to the amputation, current activity levels and activity limitations, and expected long term activity levels and potential limitations. Details regarding the patient\u2019s participation and participation restrictions in the major domains of everyday life should be ascertained. The patient\u2019s motivation for therapy and improvement in activity and participation levels are influenced by numerous factors. Decreased motivation should be explored and contributing factors such as depression, grief reaction, medical complications or lack of supportive environment should be addressed as they arise. The patient\u2019s emotional state, their reaction to the disease process and to the amputation itself, and their overall psychological condition should be assessed. The patient\u2019s social environment, social support network, and physical environment to which they will return following their hospitalisation should be assessed. Phases in the Rehabilitation Process \u00b6 Rehabilitation of the patient with an amputation can be divided into a number of phases which are defined according to the specific rehabilitation goals. Table 1 describes the phases of amputee rehabilitation. The Preoperative Phase \u00b6 The rehabilitation process commences prior to the amputation. In very acute or emergency amputations it may not be possible for a preoperative rehabilitation consultation to be arranged. In chronic deteriorating conditions, the rehabilitation program may continue during the phase of deterioration with the aim of maintaining the patient\u2019s function, including range of motion of joints, mobility, muscle strength, and cardio-respiratory fitness, or targeted interventions to improve the patient\u2019s function. The aim during this phase of chronic disease and chronic deterioration is to maintain maximum possible physical activity and function which will enable the patient to have the best possible outcome of rehabilitation following amputation. A full assessment of the patient should be carried out by the rehabilitation team prior to the amputation. This will include full physical and functional assessments, a history of the patient\u2019s psycho-social environment as described above, and if required, an assessment of their home environment. Assessment of the home environment is essential to gain an understanding of the patient\u2019s activity and participation levels preoperatively as well as in the recent past. Alternatively, if major modifications are required for the home to be accessible to the amputee, then these modifications can already be taking place during the pre- or perioperative phases of rehabilitation.

Follow-up Lifelong prosthetic, functional and medical assessment, emotional support Level of Amputation The rehabilitation consultant and other members of the rehabilitation team may be involved in advising the surgeon on the appropriate level of amputation. The basic rule of amputation is that the more that remains of the limb, the better the ultimate function of the patient. The underlying principle should be to save \u2018life before limb, but limb is life too\u2019. 16 This principle needs to be tempered by what is viable and what is appropriate surgically. Many factors need to be taken into account. A stump of any length can be fitted with an appropriate prosthesis, but some stumps are easier to fit than others. Generally, residual stumps less than 10 cm in length are difficult to fit with prosthesis unless the joint above the amputation is also incorporated into the prosthesis for the establishment and maintenance of stability. Encasing the joint in the prosthesis, however, reduces or eliminates the useful function of that joint. Short residual stumps give a short mechanical lever and moment arm making movement of the adjacent joint more difficult. Long residual transfemoral stumps may make it difficult to accommodate the prosthetic knee joint, resulting in the anatomical and prosthetic knees being at different heights. Similarly, through-knee amputations will create unequal upper leg length when fitting a prosthesis and the knee may protrude through the clothes on sitting. Long transtibial stumps are generally not recommended because of the relatively poor blood supply in the distal third of the leg below the knee. Determination of amputation levels ultimately requires consideration of all factors, including the potential for primary healing in an optimal time frame. For a transtibial amputation, the level which would be recommended is the standard transtibial level as described in Table 2 . The proviso is that there is adequate viable muscle to cover the bone distally so that skin adhesion to the bone edge is minimised and there is minimal risk of bony protrusion through the skin. For transfemoral amputation, the preferred level of amputation is the medium transfemoral level. Table 2 describes the levels of amputation. A detailed preoperative assessment requires a thorough assessment of sensation of the limbs, and a full muscular skeletal examination looking for weakness, contractures or deformities as previously mentioned, as well as a review of the vascular system including peripheral perfusion and the presence of any pressure ulcers, a cognitive assessment, and an assessment of the coping skills the patient utilises in dealing with traumatic life events. A full vascular examination and investigation should be carried out but this is beyond the scope of this chapter and should generally be done by the vascular surgeon prior to amputation. Table 2 Levels of amputation in the lower limb Hemipelvectomy Loss of any part of the ilium, ischium or pubis Hip disarticulation Loss of all of the femur Short transfemoral \\<35% of the femur Medium transfemoral 35-60% of the femur Long transfemoral >60% of the femur Knee disarticulation Through the knee, loss of all of tibia and fibula Very short transtibial \\<20% of tibial length Standard transtibial 20-50% of tibial length Long transtibial >50% of tibial length Syme amputation Ankle disarticulation with retention heel pad Chopart Disarticulation through the midtarsal joint (Calcaneus and talus are retained) Lisfranc Amputation between the tarsus and the metatarsus Transmetatarsal Through the metatarsal bones Ray Amputation of one or more digits, but not the whole forefoot, usually at the metatarsal level The patient\u2019s expectations of the rehabilitation program should be ascertained and rehabilitation outcomes discussed, with the purpose of moulding realistic patient goals early in the rehabilitation process. Anticipated outcome categories following amputation are summarised in Table 3 below: Table 3 Outline of broad prognostic categories following amputation Broad prognostic categories Unilateral \u2013 Transtibial: almost all patients will return to pre-amputation mobility (if they can don and doff prosthesis) Unilateral \u2013 Transfemoral: most patients become part-time prosthetic users. Older patients may rely more on wheelchairs Bilateral \u2013 simultaneous: older and frail patients are unlikely to return to mobilising; younger, fitter patients usually manage, but may be part-time wheel chair users Sequential: a better prognosis for returning to independent mobility Clinical justification to support selection, and determination of rehabilitation goals and prognosis, should be given to the patients. This should include consideration of the increased energy requirements of prosthetic ambulation as outlined in Table 4 , and the interaction with any comorbidities and premorbid fitness levels. Setting and communicating appropriate expected time parameters to achieve goal and sub-goals ensures that the patient has a clear understanding of the rehabilitation process. Table 4 Percentage increase in energy use for various levels of amputation (per unit distance, as patients partially compensate by walking slower so the increase per unit time is minimised) Level of amputation Percentage increase in energy requirements for ambulation per unit distance Forefoot 0-10 Hindfoot 0-25 Transtibial 25-50 Knee disarticulation 25-50 Transfemoral 50-100 Hip Disarticulation 100 Preoperative pain management is essential. There is considerable evidence that good pain control preoperatively results in decreased pain and improved outcomes following an amputation. Pain management may include all the modalities which are discussed in the subsequent section. Finally, the rehabilitation physician may be asked to assist in optimising the medical status of the patient prior to amputation. It may also be appropriate to involve other medical specialities to ensure all comorbidities are adequately controlled and treated for optimal preoperative and immediate postoperative medical outcomes. The Acute Postsurgical Phase \u00b6 The major areas of attention in the acute postoperative phase are continuation of medical treatment and medical stabilisation, wound management, and preventative rehabilitation strategies to minimise deconditioning. Generally, the postoperative wound and stump care is prescribed by the surgeon. Usually, it is appropriate to leave the dressing intact for several days following the operation unless there are specific indications such as haemorrhage, odour suggesting underlying pathology. This is partially dependent on surgical preferences and there is no definitive evidence to show how long a wound should be left untouched following an operation. The aetiology of the wound, the expected rate of recovery, and expected rate of potential complications will determine the surgical management at this stage. Delays in wound healing may require antimicrobial dressings, negative pressure therapy, further surgery for secondary closure, single or repeated debridements for wounds which are infected or unclean, and ultimately skin grafts or rotation flaps for wounds where there is insufficient skin to allow primary or secondary closure and coverage of the stump. While skin grafts are sometimes unavoidable, in general, the surgeon should be advised against skin grafts as the areas which are grafted will be insensate and there is a higher rate of wound breakdown and medium to long-term complications. The rehabilitation program for the person following an amputation should be individualised. Patient factors, wound factors, the surgeon\u2019s preferences, and the unit preferences all contribute to determining the exact program. There is no overwhelming evidence in the literature that dictates a particular approach. Generally, the patient should be encouraged to sit out of bed as early as possible, preferably within the first 2-3 days. An active rehabilitation program should be commenced, progressively increasing activity levels as the medical and surgical status of the patient allows. Range of motion exercises should be prescribed for all limbs including the amputated limb. Exercises to strengthen and prevent deconditioning of all muscle groups in both the upper and lower limbs are essential to ensure the optimal level of physical fitness of the patient at this stage. Optimal perioperative fitness will allow the patient to progress to standing and transfer practice at the earliest opportunity. On day 3 postoperatively, the patient should commence standing, transfer practice, and mobilising with appropriate aids. Studies comparing immediate postoperative mobilisation with a variety of prosthetic aids have not demonstrated any clear long-term benefits. It is common practice to mobilise patients with aids, allowing hopping on one leg on an interim basis for 1-2 weeks in order to allow some wound healing to take place prior to fitting prosthesis. The stump needs to be protected at least when the patient is in the upright position, but preferably for most, if not all, of the time. Many patients instinctively attempt to stand on the amputated leg at some stage in the immediate postoperative phase resulting in a fall and injury to the stump if it is not protected. Once there is evidence of wound healing without complications such as dehiscence, extensive haematoma, or infections, and once the sutures have been removed and there is reasonable pain control, the patient is ready for the next phase of rehabilitation. There is some evidence that even if the wound is not healing completely, prosthetic mobilisation can be undertaken and may be beneficial. 17 Attention should be given to prophylaxis to prevent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Generally this is carried out using prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparins. As nutritional requirements are increased following any operation, an assessment should be carried out during the pre-, peri- and the immediate postoperative phases and a nutritional strategy put in place. The main surgical objective in the acute postsurgical phase is promotion of wound healing. The surgeon contributes to wound healing by minimising exposure to potential pathogens, minimising the pressure and tension on the wound through intraoperative haemostasis, and prevention or minimisation of perioperative wound oedema. A variety of wound dressings have been advocated to assist in wound healing. These include simple soft gauze dressings, rigid dressings and more recently removable rigid dressings. Wound Dressings Although considerable literature has been published regarding the best kinds of perioperative dressings, there is no overwhelming evidence to promote any particular dressing. 18 19 The clinician treating patients following amputation should have a basic understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the various types of dressings. There is a tendency for patients who are treated with rigid dressings to have a better outcome in the short term, whereas the long-term functional and mobility outcome seems to be independent of the perioperative dressing. Soft gauze dressings are easy to apply, are low cost, and allow accessibility to the wound as required. The disadvantages of soft gauze dressing are summarised in Table 5 . Table 5 Disadvantages of soft gauze dressings Tendency to loosen and fall off Do not control oedema Potential generation of high pressures points that impair skin survival and healing Increased tendency for the development of knee flexion contractures Association with more conservative management including More prolonged best rest Immobilisation Higher risk of complications associated with this Higher health care costs if there is a longer inpatient stay In some cases there may be a higher level of pain requiring additional treatment In the long term, healing rates, pain control and prosthetic use are comparable to long-term outcomes associated with the use of other dressings. Rigid dressings are usually applied by the surgeon in theatre, or by the prosthetist or physiotherapist in theatre, or in the recovery unit. The relative advantages of rigid dressings are summarised in Table 6 . A major disadvantage of rigid dressings is the decreased ability to monitor the stump, which is only possible at routine changes of the cast or on removal of the rigid dressing solely for the purpose of viewing the stump. Other disadvantages include an inability to progressively mould the stump and support stump shrinkage except at times of cast changes. This type of dressing is resource intensive requiring an experienced prosthetist or physiotherapist to be present at completion of surgery, at every cast change, and whenever an acute problem develops. The process of casting, removal and re-casting is also time consuming. Application immediately after surgery, either in theatre or the recovery room, is required as this minimises the potential for stump oedema to develop. Rigid dressings have decreased the need for higher level revision amputation from 22% to 6% compared to soft gauze dressings. 20 Rigid dressings are contraindicated in the presence of local infection or significant oedema at the amputation site, or in the presence of large amounts of adipose tissue where technical application and appropriate anchoring would present problems. Table 6 Relative advantages of rigid dressings Minimise oedema development Provide protection from external trauma Allow an acceleration of the prosthetic rehabilitation process Reduce pain and phantom sensation Minimise and reduce the postsurgical inflammatory response Reduce healing time Increase tolerance to weight bearing which may allow earlier mobilisation with a prosthesis Simplify nursing care Improve ability and accelerate stump shaping Support circulation The more recently developed removable rigid dressing is a commonly used compromise. 21 It still needs to be applied by an experienced person in theatre or in the recovery unit, but it can be removed by anyone at any time and reapplied after viewing the wound. It is especially useful for open wounds. The advantages are similar to those of a rigid dressing and it has also been shown to improve the short-term rehabilitation outcome without any long term effect. 22 There is no difference in complication rates when compared to the rigid dressing. Currently in many teams, removable rigid dressings are the treatment of choice. Recently a number of other dressings have been used. Vacuum-formed removable rigid dressings , at least in one study, have produced similar results to rigid plaster dressings. 23 Polymer impregnated socks are thin, lightweight, removable thermoplastic/silicone type socks which provide rigid support, decrease the shear forces, and provide good stump compression. The socks can also reduce the time taken for the stump to be ready for prosthesis fitting. 24 Pain and Phantom Sensation Stump pain, phantom sensations, phantom pain and musculoskeletal pain are frequently present after an amputation. The underlying pathology which has precipitated the amputation may have been causing considerable pain prior to the amputation. There is some evidence that good pain control prior to the amputation, and in the perioperative period, results in improved postoperative pain control in the long term. 25 26 27 28 29 30 Adequate management of pain, or prevention of pain, results in a better outcome than trying to control pain after it has become established. In pain management, it is useful to use standardised tools, such as a visual analogue scale to quantify the pain. This will also enable quantification of treatment effects. Stump pain refers to any pain in the residual limb. In the perioperative setting this is most commonly associated with the surgery, although it may also be associated with the underlying condition or other factors. The incidence of stump pain reaches about 70 % and is most common in the immediate postoperative period, decreasing with time following the amputation. 31 32 Surgical pain in the patient with an amputation is treated as any other postsurgical pain. This pain responds well to narcotic analgesics and subsides quickly with time following surgery as the traumatised tissues heal. Beyond the postoperative phase, narcotic analgesics should not be used. There may be residual pain from the underlying ischemia in the amputated leg or in the contralateral leg and this may require treatment. Neuroma formation and an ill-fitting prosthesis are common causes of stump pain in the medium to long term. Neuromas are responsive to treatment with a local anaesthetic infusion but if resistant to this, resection may be required. Phantom sensation refers to all painless sensations in the amputated part of the limb. Although not completely understood, phantom sensations are likely to be associated with the central nervous system processing of stimuli which are perceived to come from the amputated limb. Most patients with an amputation will experience phantom sensations which may be felt as temperature variation, cramping, tingling and so on. Phantom sensations are best dealt with by reassuring patients about their benign nature and normality. Generally the sensations decrease in intensity and frequency over time, and treatment should only be considered if they cause considerable disruption to function or lifestyle. Phantom pain is defined as any phantom sensation that is so intense that it is experienced as painful. Phantom pain is very common and reported by 50 to 85% of all patients. 33 It may continue to be a problem in up to 40% of patients one year after the amputation. Variability of quality and intensity of pain, and differences in description, make analysis of the literature dealing with phantom limb pain difficult. While the frequency and duration of phantom limb pain seem to decrease in the first six months following amputation, the intensity of the pain can remain relatively unchanged. Risk factors associated with phantom pain, especially in the early postoperative phase, include the intensity and duration of pre-amputation pain, but less so for long-term phantom pain. Treatment of phantom pain has received considerable attention in the literature. Numerous treatments, including pharmaceutical treatments, psychological techniques, physical modalities and mirror therapy have been suggested but none of them is totally effective. The treatments are summarised in Table 7 . Medications commonly used in the treatment of neuropathic and phantom pain are the anticonvulsant and the antidepressant groups of medication. The actual pharmaceutical agent or non-pharmaceutical treatment that is used is determined by scientific evidence, local practice, availability and price. Actual choice of medications or treatment should be based on the side effect profile of the drugs and therapeutic modalities, the medical comorbidities, and the patient\u2019s physical and medical conditions. Table 8 summarises \u201cA Treatment Approach to Neuropathic Pain\u201d by R H Dworkin et al. Patients with an amputation commonly develop musculoskeletal pain in the lower back, the contralateral knee or other areas. This may follow amputation acutely or as a medium to long-term problem. Assessment needs to be carried out to identify and treat any remediable local or prosthetic factor which contributes to secondary musculoskeletal pain. These could include poor prosthetic fitting with decreasing weight bearing on the prosthesis, leg length discrepancies secondary to incorrect height of the prosthesis, or gait pattern alterations following prosthetic fitting. The prosthetic limb is generally about 1cm shorter than the remaining limb to allow easier clearance during the swing phase. If prosthetic issues or pain secondary to use of walking aids are identified, they should be corrected, but where these are not identifiable, then the pain should be treated as any other musculoskeletal pain and the reader is referred to more comprehensive works regarding treatment of musculoskeletal and chronic pain. Pre-prosthetic Phase \u00b6 The pre-prosthetic phase of rehabilitation for the patient with an amputation generally commences between one and three weeks after amputation. The predominant focus of care changes from the surgical and medical aspects of care to rehabilitation. In some units this may be the time for the patient to be prepared for discharge. The pre-prosthetic phase may therefore take place in the acute unit, in the inpatient rehabilitation unit or in an outpatient setting with the patient at home. The major focus is to prepare the patient for successful fitting of a prosthesis and to prepare the psychosocial and home environment for transfer of the patient back into the community. This specifically includes stump shaping, stump shrinkage, increasing muscle strength and restoring the patient locus of control. Generally, about 3 weeks after surgery, the wound is ready for removal of sutures or clips depending on the procedure used by the surgeon. If there are wound complications, the management is carried out in consultation with the surgeon who performed the amputation. Stump Shaping Stump preparation is required to facilitate prosthetic fitting. This involves reducing the stump oedema, an extension of the treatment by acute wound dressings as discussed earlier. Further reduction of oedema is facilitated by application of an elastic bandage or an elastic sock, commonly called a stump shrinker. The bandage or shrinker should apply graduated pressure, with Table 7 Commonly employed treatments for phantom limb pain based on publication by Flor 34 Pharmacological Conventional analgesics Opioids Calcitonin \u03b2-Blockers Neuroleptics Anticonvulsives Gabapentin Antidepressants Amitriptyline Muscle relaxants Surgical Stump revision Neurectomy Sympathectomy Rhizotomy Cordotomy Tractotomy Dorsal column stimulation Anaesthesiological Nerve blocks Epidural block Sympathetic block Local anaesthesia Lignocaine Psychological Electomyographic biofeedback Temperature biofeedback Cognitive-behavioural pain management Hypnosis Other Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation Acupuncture Physical therapy Ultrasound Manipulation Electromagnetic stump line Mirror therapy \u2013 preamputation Mirror therapy \u2013 postamputation Wearing prosthesis greater pressure distally, to minimise interstitial fluid. Figures 2 and 3 give a step by step description on how to apply a stump bandage. Alternatively, a precast silicone sock may be used as a stump shrinker. Reducing the oedema assists with improving circulation to the stump. Table 8 Stepwise pharmacologic management of Neuropathic Pain (NP) 35 Stepwise pharmacologic management of Neuropathic Pain (NP) Step 1 Assess pain and establish the diagnosis of NP; if uncertain about the diagnosis, refer to a pain specialist or neurologist. Establish and treat the cause of NP; if uncertain about availability of treatments addressing NP aetiology, refer to appropriate specialist. Identify relevant comorbidities (e.g., cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease, depression, gait instability) that might be relieved or exacerbated by NP treatment, or that might require dosage adjustment or additional monitoring of therapy. Explain the diagnosis and treatment plan to the patient, and establish realistic expectations. Step 2 Initiate therapy of the disease causing NP, if applicable. Initiate symptom treatment with one or more of the following: A secondary amine Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA) (nortriptyline, desipramine) or a selective Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SSNRI) (duloxetine, venlafaxine). A calcium channel alpha 2-sigma ligand, either gabapentin or pregabalin. For patients with localised peripheral NP: topical lignocaine used alone or in combination with one of the other first-line therapies. For patients with acute neuropathic pain, neuropathic cancer pain, or episodic exacerbations of severe pain, and when prompt pain relief during titration of a first-line medication to an efficacious dosage is required, opioid analgesics or tramadol may be used alone or in combination with one of the first-line therapies. Evaluate patient for non-pharmacologic treatments, and initiate if appropriate. Step 3 Reassess pain and health-related quality of life frequently using standardised tools. If substantial pain relief (e.g. average pain reduced to <3/10) and tolerable side effects, continue treatment. If partial pain relief (e.g. average pain remains >4/10) after an adequate trial, add one of the other first-line medications. If no or inadequate pain relief (e.g. <30% reduction) at target dosage after an adequate trial, switch to an alternative first-line medication. Step 4 If trials of first-line medications, alone and in combination, fail, consider second- and third-line medications or referral to a pain specialist or multidisciplinary pain centre. Prevention of Contractures Prevention of contractures is essential for the patient to achieve maximum functional recovery. It is best commenced in the preoperative setting with a program of education and self-directed or supervised exercises to maintain and, if possible or necessary, to improve the range of motion of all joints of the lower limb in particular, but also of the upper limbs. Postoperatively, it is common for a surgeon to prefer that the joint next to the amputation be rested so as not to stress the wound. In that case, if it is the knee or the hip joint, it should be rested in extension as far as possible, as flexion contractures make mobilisation difficult. The other joints of the lower and upper limbs need to be dealt with in the same manner as described in the preoperative program. In the case of a transtibial amputation, extension of the knee is often achieved by fitting a plaster cast either in theatre or as soon as is practical after the operation, encasing the knee joint to ensure it is kept in extension. If this is not possible, then appropriate attention needs to be given in the postoperative rehabilitation program. A stump board can be used on the wheelchair. To assist in maintaining a range of motion, the patient is generally mobilised as soon as possible. Figure 2 Procedure on how to apply a stump bandage for a transfemoral amputation Encouragement may be required to position the lower limb joints and to avoid contractures or to stretch out any early contractures. The patient needs to be vigilant in this important aspect of their care. A program of prone lying up to 30 minutes twice daily to prevent hip flexion contractures is recommended for those that can tolerate this. Figure 4 outlines a programme of exercises to prevent contractures Patient Goal Setting \u00b6 Patients with an amputation require a structured, efficient, specialised multidisciplinary team to achieve the best outcomes. Following comprehensive assessment of pre-amputation function, activity and participation level, progress following surgery, and the patient\u2019s current status, the rehabilitation prognosis will be refined. Fine tuning of the prognosis is done at rehabilitation case conferences where all team members meet either with the patient being present or, if not present, being informed of the discussion outside of the team meeting. Based on the prognosis, goals are set with the patient, and their carer, where appropriate. A family conference can assist in communicating the prognosis to the patient and carers, increasing the team\u2019s understanding of the home environment and psychosocial support network, as well as refining patient goals. Short and long-term patient goals should be set. These goals need to be realistic and achievable. An indicative time frame for goal attainment should be given and a date for review should be set. This ensures adequate review and tracking of the patient\u2019s progress. Patient involvement is essential as this increases cooperation and compliance with treatment and gives feedback regarding their progress through the rehabilitation program. At regular reviews, most commonly at the weekly case conferences, the goals are reviewed and adjusted as required. The patient goals and their progress should be documented in the treatment plan. Figure 3 Procedure on how to apply a stump bandage for a transtibial amputation Agreement is required as to whether prosthetic rehabilitation should proceed as inpatient or outpatient treatment as this has an impact on the major focus of the pre-prosthetic phase. Patients who can mobilise and transfer independently with aids, who are able to attend to personal self-care either independently or with available community support, and who can access both home and rehabilitation facilities, can be discharged into the community at this stage. They can complete their pre-prosthetic and other rehabilitation from home. Medium to long-term outcomes of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation for the patient with an amputation seem to be similar although there is little published data about this. Physical Conditioning \u00b6 Rehabilitation following an amputation and mobilisation with a prosthesis is physically demanding. A physical conditioning program to maximise function and performance with and without a prosthesis is initiated. A strengthening program for the upper limbs will enable the patient to mobilise with aids after an amputation. With sufficient strength present in the upper limbs, the patient may be able to mobilise with crutches on the remaining leg. In all cases the patient will benefit from strong upper limbs to assist with transfers and weight bearing with or without a prosthesis. Strengthening the muscles of the remaining lower limb will improve stability in standing and allow forward propulsion on walking. Trunk muscle strengthening will allow better stability in view of the asymmetry of the body following amputation. Amputation has a severe impact on a patient\u2019s dynamic and static balance and changes the centre of gravity. The patient therefore needs a balance retraining program, starting with sitting balance and progressing to supported standing and single limb balance in the pre-prosthetic phase. Further balance training will be required in the prosthetic fitting phase and whenever the components of the prosthesis are significantly altered. In view of the increased energy demands of prosthetic ambulation, a cardiorespiratory fitness and endurance program will prepare the patient for mobilisation with aids and a prosthesis. Cardiorespiratory fitness ultimately determines the patient\u2019s ability to mobilise outdoors and over longer distances. Transfer and Mobility Training \u00b6 Transfer training should commence early following an amputation, preferably even before amputation, and should initially be practised without, and later with, a prosthesis in situ. The patient should practice transfers from sitting to standing, bed to chair, chair to toilet, chair to bath or shower chair, car transfers, and off the floor transfers. Independence in mobility is attained most rapidly if the patient is initially mobilised in a wheelchair. Increasing independence is therapeutic and a strong motivation for patients. Most patients should initially be mobilised as early as possible in a wheelchair. If the home set-up is suitable the patient can then also be discharged with a wheelchair. Figure 4 Exercises for prevention of contractures Activity of Daily Living Training \u00b6 The patient should be trained to be independent in all activities of daily living with appropriate aids as required in the postoperative phase. This may require an adaptive environment if the patient is wheelchair bound and might require further modification as the patient\u2019s mobility status progresses. Wheelchair and Equipment Prescription \u00b6 A suitable wheelchair should be provided for patient use in the postoperative period. Wheelchairs for amputees should have their rear axle offset posteriorly to counterbalance the posterior shift of the centre of gravity in the patient who has had an amputation. Psychological Issues \u00b6 An amputation signifies an irreversible loss of body integrity to the patient. As with other types of loss, amputation can be accompanied by a grieving process. A patient might go through the usual stages of grieving. It has been suggested that individuals who have experienced a significant change in physical appearance and function, including amputation, go through 3 phases of adaptation to their changed body image. Initially, there is a period of shock and denial followed by \u201cwishing for restoration\u201d (the patient disguises or hides the change of body image) and ultimately ending in \u201creimaging the self\u201d some 18 months after the event. In the period of reimaging the self, the patient realises the implications of their loss, understands and accepts their altered body image and is able to adjust their lives to their changed definition of identity and self-image. 36 Depression is common following an amputation in the initial post-amputation phase. It often resolves during inpatient rehabilitation, but the incidence rises again after discharge. 37 It may be a reactive depression or a normal reaction to losing a limb. The rate of depression continues to be higher in the first and second year following an amputation but it then decreases to the normal expected population rates. 38 The prevalence of anxiety is also increased in the first year post amputation and then decreases to a rate similar to that observed in the general population. There is a complex adaptation to the altered body image which needs to take place. It has been suggested that the amputee undergoes several adaptations to their body image. Initially, they have their pre-amputation body image. Subsequently, they adjust to the body image without a prosthesis and then they adjust again to their body image with a prosthesis. This adjustment process may take a period of months to years. Psychological support is essential for the patient to adapt appropriately. This may be in the form of psychological support including psychotherapeutic and psycho-education interventions for the patient, carers and family. Individual or group therapy may be utilised. Specific interventions may also target depression and anxiety as is required. Sexuality \u00b6 Many people with limb amputation report reduced libido. Limb amputation does not directly affect the sexual functioning unless there are other associated injuries. It is possible that the person with an amputation may be embarrassed to show their amputated limb to their partner. Surveys suggest that the majority of patients with amputation engage in sexual activity, including intercourse. 39 Overall, there are only a few papers dealing with the sexuality of amputees. Sexuality should be discussed with the patient, and although the sexual function of people with a limb amputation, including fertility and pregnancy, is rarely impaired, other issues relating to body image may impact on sexual activity and sexuality. Stump Protection \u00b6 Reviews of below-knee amputees have indicated that up to about one quarter suffer trauma to their stumps, with 80% of traumas occurring as a result of a fall. 40 About half of patients who suffered a fall required revision surgery including above-knee amputation. Stump protection can minimise stump trauma and the need for stump protection is particularly high in the early phase. The stump can be protected by a number of methods including rigid plaster dressing, removable rigid dressings or prefabricated covers. Prefabricated covers are made by the major suppliers of prosthetic and orthotic equipment. Another method is the use of prefabricated pneumatic dressings which may also be used with prosthetic attachments. As patients may be impulsive, the stump protection should preferably be worn at all times including overnight, as many of the falls occur when the patient is less well oriented, particularly at night when they might attempt to stand up spontaneously. For overnight use, the removable rigid dressing or the rigid dressing are the best options. There are few studies on the relative advantages of the various types of stump protection. There are, however, significantly fewer postsurgical complications, and fewer patients requiring high levels of revision, when they are used. Concluding Remarks \u00b6 Rehabilitation of the amputee is one of the most rewarding experiences in rehabilitation work. With appropriate motivation, education, cooperation, mutual support, and supply of an appropriate prosthesis, the patient is able to approximate their previous activity and participation levels and conduct a lifestyle which can include many of the activities which they carried out premorbidly. There are many facets in dealing with the amputee, and a multidisciplinary team approach assists the patient in dealing with the challenges of their life as an amputee.

Kohler \u201cAmputation is the beginning and not the end of a treatment\u201d 1 Amputation is a common late consequence of peripheral vascular disease or diabetes, or a result of accidental trauma, civil unrest or landmines. The actual impairment may affect many facets of life including, but not limited to, mobility, activities of daily living, body image and sexuality. Amputation is defined as the surgical, congenital or spontaneous, partial or complete removal of a limb or protecting body part covered by skin. This generally occurs in the transverse plane, but may be in the longitudinal plane if part of a limb is removed. 2 Rehabilitation of the person with an amputation of the lower limb is an excellent example of the true multidisciplinary nature of rehabilitation. There are a few areas within rehabilitation where the prevention of secondary functional loss and restoration of function can be as effective as training a person with an amputation in the use of prosthesis. Every rehabilitation service following an amputation aims to provide the patient who has lost function or ability with the highest possible level of independence (physically, psychologically, socially and economically). 3 This objective is achieved through the combined and coordinated use of medical, nursing and allied health professional skills in collaboration with the patient\u2019s personal and environmental resources. The process requires individualised assessments and treatment plans with regular review. Treatment occurs in the acute hospital, in the inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation setting, as well as in the community. Service provision should be seamless across these settings to achieve optimal functional recovery in the shortest time frame.","title":"Lower Limb Amputation"},{"location":"chap6/#incidence-and-prevalence","text":"The incidence and prevalence of amputation is difficult to determine precisely on a worldwide basis. Reasons for this include the multiple pathological aetiologies which culminate in amputation, the various definitions of clinically significant amputations, the incidence of multiple amputations being performed on the same individual and the same limb but at sequentially and progressively more proximal levels, and the underlying difficulty and deficiency of retrospective data collection in a large number of studies. 4 The major diseases that contribute to amputation include arteriovenous occlusive vascular disease, diabetes mellitus and tumours. There is considerable variation in reported amputation rates between countries. For patients with diabetes and on dialysis, the incidence rate of amputation has been reported as lowest in Japan and highest in Belgium, France and Germany 5 . In Europe the prevalence of persons with an amputation is between 17 and 30 per 100,000. 6 In industrialised countries roughly 65 \u2013 75% of amputations are as a result of underlying disease. The remainder are mostly trauma related, usually secondary to motor vehicle, industrial or farming accidents. In industrialised nations, vascular complications of diabetes are the principal cause of amputation often aggravated by the use of tobacco. In the USA, the annual incidence of non-traumatic amputation of limbs over the last decade is between 22 and 31 per 100,000. 7 Over the last decade there has been evidence of a decreasing rate of amputation for type 1 diabetes mellitus and non-diabetes-related minor amputations and a simultaneous increase in minor and major amputations for type 2 diabetes. 8 Nonindustrial countries have a higher incidence of amputation due to the higher rate of war and trauma, and less developed medical systems. In the large number of countries which have had recent or ongoing warfare or civil unrest, trauma can account for over 80% of amputations. 9 It is expected that the incidence of amputations will continue to increase in the foreseeable future in view of the increasing global incidence and prevalence of diabetes secondary to changing dietary habits, the on-going international and national disputes with continued utilisation of large numbers of land mines, and the increasing motorisation in non-industrialised nations.","title":"Incidence and Prevalence"},{"location":"chap6/#prognosis","text":"The mortality rate of amputees is strongly influenced by the high incidence of comorbidities especially in the dysvascular amputee. Studies suggest that the mortality rate for individuals with a non-traumatic amputation of the lower limb is of the order of 40 - 50% within 2 years, and 60 - 70% within 5 years of surgery. 10 Following amputation the median time to death for patients with diabetes was 27 months compared to 47 months for patients without diabetes. 11 The rate of contralateral amputation is about 15-20% at 2 years. Patients with diabetes have a greater than tenfold increase in the incidence of new amputation compared to those without diabetes. There is a further increased risk of mortality with the relative risk of 1.54 and a mean survival of 2 years for diabetic patients who are on haemodialysis and have an amputation. In the decade up to 2005 there has been no change in prognosis following amputation but the age at amputation has increased suggesting improved pre-amputation care. 12 Higher levels of amputation are related to a shorter median time of survival. 13 For functional ability, prognosis is inversely related to increasing age and increasing number of comorbidities, and directly related to compliance with treatment. 14","title":"Prognosis"},{"location":"chap6/#the-specialised-rehabilitation-team-for-persons-with-an-amputation","text":"Rehabilitation for patients following amputation is most effective with the input of a coordinated multidisciplinary team.

Figure 1 Members of the rehabilitation team The patient\u2019s individual needs are central to all team members. A peer support program is common practice now.

Full assessment of the patient includes a detailed assessment of the medical condition, including any comorbidities and predisposing factors to underlying vascular and peripheral vascular disease in particular, but also any other medical diseases which may interfere with the patient\u2019s activity levels and ability to mobilise. There should be an investigation into any medical or surgical conditions related to the underlying disease process such as coincidental ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease, complications related to the surgery such as delayed wound healing and wound infection, or pressure areas at other sites of the body. A detailed examination of the contralateral limb, as well as the upper limbs, is essential. A detailed examination of the limbs should be performed and recorded. This includes a muscle chart for the major muscle groups in both the upper and lower limbs, the range of movement of all the joints of the lower limbs, and also of the upper limbs (which will be essential for mobility with the use of aids), a record of the presence or absence, and quality, of pulses in the lower limbs (femoral, popliteal and pedal pulses) and the upper limbs, and any evidence of radial-femoral delay. Documentation of other markers of impaired circulation such as trophic changes of the nails and skin, changes to the hair distribution, or the presence of pregangrenous or gangrenous states is essential. The sensation of the stump and of the contralateral leg is important. Pain sensation is important for the patient to perceive any impending problems with the stump/prosthesis interface such as skin breakdown. It is particularly important to examine proprioception as the patient with the amputation relies largely on the proprioceptive impulses from the stump and the joint above the amputation for feedback regarding the position in space of the prosthesis. Proprioception in the remaining limb is relevant as the patient is more reliant on the proprioceptive feedback from the remaining foot and ankle joints to determine the stance and gait parameters. Postoperatively, a very detailed examination of the stump is essential. This includes an examination of the wound and the degree and progress of wound healing in comparison to expected progress. The circulation of the skin, in particular the circulation around the skin flap of the stump and around the suture line is assessed by determining the temperature, the presence or absence of pain, pallor, petechiae, cyanosis or poor capillary return, all of which may be indicative of stump ischemia. The circulation of the remaining limb is assessed in order to determine potential problems of the contralateral limb as well. The length and shape of the stump, the degree of oedema of the stump, tenderness of the skin flap, erythema around the suture line, presence of necrosis of the wound margin, wound dehiscence and the presence, type and amount of wound exudate and any other factors relevant to stump healing are assessed. Presence of pain, the range of movement and the strength of the musculature in the joint immediately above the amputation, and the strength of the musculature of the amputated side overall should be assessed and recorded, although at this stage detailed examination may be impeded by postsurgical pain. A detailed history and examination of the patient\u2019s activity levels and limitations of activity is required. This should include premorbid activity and activity limitations, a time frame and a rate of deterioration of activity prior to the amputation, current activity levels and activity limitations, and expected long term activity levels and potential limitations. Details regarding the patient\u2019s participation and participation restrictions in the major domains of everyday life should be ascertained. The patient\u2019s motivation for therapy and improvement in activity and participation levels are influenced by numerous factors. Decreased motivation should be explored and contributing factors such as depression, grief reaction, medical complications or lack of supportive environment should be addressed as they arise. The patient\u2019s emotional state, their reaction to the disease process and to the amputation itself, and their overall psychological condition should be assessed. The patient\u2019s social environment, social support network, and physical environment to which they will return following their hospitalisation should be assessed.","title":"Principles of Patient Assessment"},{"location":"chap6/#phases-in-the-rehabilitation-process","text":"Rehabilitation of the patient with an amputation can be divided into a number of phases which are defined according to the specific rehabilitation goals.

Following comprehensive assessment of pre-amputation function, activity and participation level, progress following surgery, and the patient\u2019s current status, the rehabilitation prognosis will be refined. Fine tuning of the prognosis is done at rehabilitation case conferences where all team members meet either with the patient being present or, if not present, being informed of the discussion outside of the team meeting. Based on the prognosis, goals are set with the patient, and their carer, where appropriate. A family conference can assist in communicating the prognosis to the patient and carers, increasing the team\u2019s understanding of the home environment and psychosocial support network, as well as refining patient goals. Short and long-term patient goals should be set. These goals need to be realistic and achievable. An indicative time frame for goal attainment should be given and a date for review should be set. This ensures adequate review and tracking of the patient\u2019s progress. Patient involvement is essential as this increases cooperation and compliance with treatment and gives feedback regarding their progress through the rehabilitation program. At regular reviews, most commonly at the weekly case conferences, the goals are reviewed and adjusted as required. The patient goals and their progress should be documented in the treatment plan. Figure 3 Procedure on how to apply a stump bandage for a transtibial amputation Agreement is required as to whether prosthetic rehabilitation should proceed as inpatient or outpatient treatment as this has an impact on the major focus of the pre-prosthetic phase. Patients who can mobilise and transfer independently with aids, who are able to attend to personal self-care either independently or with available community support, and who can access both home and rehabilitation facilities, can be discharged into the community at this stage.

As with other types of loss, amputation can be accompanied by a grieving process. A patient might go through the usual stages of grieving. It has been suggested that individuals who have experienced a significant change in physical appearance and function, including amputation, go through 3 phases of adaptation to their changed body image. Initially, there is a period of shock and denial followed by \u201cwishing for restoration\u201d (the patient disguises or hides the change of body image) and ultimately ending in \u201creimaging the self\u201d some 18 months after the event. In the period of reimaging the self, the patient realises the implications of their loss, understands and accepts their altered body image and is able to adjust their lives to their changed definition of identity and self-image. 36 Depression is common following an amputation in the initial post-amputation phase. It often resolves during inpatient rehabilitation, but the incidence rises again after discharge. 37 It may be a reactive depression or a normal reaction to losing a limb. The rate of depression continues to be higher in the first and second year following an amputation but it then decreases to the normal expected population rates. 38 The prevalence of anxiety is also increased in the first year post amputation and then decreases to a rate similar to that observed in the general population. There is a complex adaptation to the altered body image which needs to take place. It has been suggested that the amputee undergoes several adaptations to their body image. Initially, they have their pre-amputation body image. Subsequently, they adjust to the body image without a prosthesis and then they adjust again to their body image with a prosthesis. This adjustment process may take a period of months to years. Psychological support is essential for the patient to adapt appropriately. This may be in the form of psychological support including psychotherapeutic and psycho-education interventions for the patient, carers and family. Individual or group therapy may be utilised. Specific interventions may also target depression and anxiety as is required.","title":"Psychological Issues"},{"location":"chap6/#sexuality","text":"Many people with limb amputation report reduced libido. Limb amputation does not directly affect the sexual functioning unless there are other associated injuries. It is possible that the person with an amputation may be embarrassed to show their amputated limb to their partner. Surveys suggest that the majority of patients with amputation engage in sexual activity, including intercourse. 39 Overall, there are only a few papers dealing with the sexuality of amputees. Sexuality should be discussed with the patient, and although the sexual function of people with a limb amputation, including fertility and pregnancy, is rarely impaired, other issues relating to body image may impact on sexual activity and sexuality.","title":"Sexuality"},{"location":"chap6/#stump-protection","text":"Reviews of below-knee amputees have indicated that up to about one quarter suffer trauma to their stumps, with 80% of traumas occurring as a result of a fall. 40 About half of patients who suffered a fall required revision surgery including above-knee amputation. Stump protection can minimise stump trauma and the need for stump protection is particularly high in the early phase. The stump can be protected by a number of methods including rigid plaster dressing, removable rigid dressings or prefabricated covers. Prefabricated covers are made by the major suppliers of prosthetic and orthotic equipment. Another method is the use of prefabricated pneumatic dressings which may also be used with prosthetic attachments. As patients may be impulsive, the stump protection should preferably be worn at all times including overnight, as many of the falls occur when the patient is less well oriented, particularly at night when they might attempt to stand up spontaneously. For overnight use, the removable rigid dressing or the rigid dressing are the best options. There are few studies on the relative advantages of the various types of stump protection. There are, however, significantly fewer postsurgical complications, and fewer patients requiring high levels of revision, when they are used.","title":"Stump Protection"},{"location":"chap6/#concluding-remarks","text":"Rehabilitation of the amputee is one of the most rewarding experiences in rehabilitation work. With appropriate motivation, education, cooperation, mutual support, and supply of an appropriate prosthesis, the patient is able to approximate their previous activity and participation levels and conduct a lifestyle which can include many of the activities which they carried out premorbidly. There are many facets in dealing with the amputee, and a multidisciplinary team approach assists the patient in dealing with the challenges of their life as an amputee.","title":"Concluding Remarks"},{"location":"chap6/#references","text":"Sir Reginald Watson-Jones quoted in: Durst J.
